"Oddly enough, I love this game. It's fun to play when I'm bored. An update idea is that maybe you could add division to the game? For example, if you had 60 people and the choices were to divide by either 2 or 3, you have to go for 2 because you lose less people. I guess it would be problematic because there are already obstacles in the game to reduce your army, but I wanted to put an idea out there. But the game is already amazing as it is and I myself am shocked that I found no problems",5

"This game is not only a work of art in the disguise, but a lens into the underworld of human suffering. The extremely boring repetition of the gameplay and animations creates a surreal feeling of redundancy and immense boredom only aided by the simplicity of the puzzles. The ads after every level creates an environment of suffering and unfairness, only comparable to the tragedies of Wlliam Shakespeare and the force of nature in many Romanticism works. This game will truly go down in history.",5

"It asks for a review a little too early. The most refreshing thing so far is the game is exactly how the adverts show it as the core of the gameplay. After getting lied to by adverts all the time this is the best thing ever. It's a fun little game to pass the time, nothing amazing though, you get exactly what you are advertised though which that alone is worth 5 stars.",5

"I not only like this game, I love it! My only thing is keep everything the way it is now but add more onto the game.

Eventually, I stopped playing around the time the update of seeing your wars that your ships were sent to came. Earlier today, I took a look at the game to make sure everything was saved and I sent my ships out to a war. While going to this war, I realized the new update which made me want to play this game more.",5

"Dragging a bunch of paint-people/soldiers/militia what ever across the field is pretty fun I've only seen this game a few times as an ad; decided to download and give it a try. It's really fun it's really easy just keep your eyes ahead of the men that you have and you'll win each level. Game does lag a little at each last boss. Ads do happen, but try to use those ads for coins &/or gems. Build up what you can & go.UPDATE every nine times a battle starts, the movement freezes up. Can't complete.",5

It takes a long time to get fun because you get an island 🏝️ and get gems But when you get like over 200 people it lags alot and sometimes it freezes and the ramps just horrible if you have a bunch of people as like 30 people make it out of the 300 and the people on the towers shoot arrows that do NOTHING but with the bad things out of the way now time for GOOD THINGS so you don't need internet and it's really easy which I like as I am now on level 320 or something and it's still easy 😃.,4
Not sure to 4/5...But I may likd this game I maybe will go and download games thaf they had created,4
Reason: adds are very annoying and it would be a 5 if there was no adds. (Just saying),4
This was a really good game but just add a little more stuff so it just not to be first,4
Ahhh ahhh ahhh Never gonna åh ahh ahh,4

Very nice.,4
Thus game is really nice but it doesn't have enough actual stuff in it . Literally all you're doing is moving to the bigger number then fighting its too easy. Also like all games it has ads and with this game I'm happy to finally say that they're not soo bad as others have been. I like this game and hope you get it .😄👍😁,4

Abhishek,4
Lag,4
Lovely really gets me thinking 😁🤔,4
🤔🤔 ok,4
"It is a good game for what you do I really like it but the reason why it is 4 stars 1. To many ads, every level you complete there is an ad. 2. When you get 200 blue guys in the game it starts lagging, I had 317 people on a bonus level and because it lagged so much I ended up having 57 because they all died and I lost that level. Apart from that good game and I highly recommend you should download it and try the app out.",4
Good Game to play,4
"Pretty entertaining game! And for those of you complaining about the ads, TURN YOUR WIFI OFF",4
"Great game, but ads are so annoying after every game... :/",4
It fun,4
"Great concept. There are a lot of ads but it's a cool game to pass time. The boards are similar so it really isn't a hard game to play. I've beat the whole US map. I was hoping it would open up other contriess or something, but it doesn't. So after you've beat all the states on the US map, you're just playing to play.",4
Fun. Ads to me aren't that bad.,4
Easy to play. Fun.,4
Decent little game only thing is lots of ads,4
Cool thanks for liking it was just the first time since I've been trying to figure it out,4
This game is good,4

Its interesting but i hope the at first the stairs are plan white. When ever the player reach the point it get coloured in different colors. So the player also will get more excited to make more points..,4

Alaina and my husband are in lowest interest for a year now but I don't know how to get it to the following year because of my job as an accountant for the following day to get agood night's job done in the following months but it is not the case with song and my friends who have a 434r3oth or something to do so I just don't want it anymore and I'm still going for a second chance and the only thing that is a really love is that you to get the most important things in the world and the game you,4
ممتعة,4
"I lierally only installed the game just to tell all of you his magic trick that makes ads go away for free called: turning off your wifi and reboot the app or go into airplane mode and reboot the app besides the very easy to solve ad problem its a pretty decent game, controls are responsive for the most part other then that good concept this was all sarcasm except the internent trick it sucks you have to use ads to level up i just wanted the people that complain about ads to do this trick",4
It's a very good and entertaining game. My issue with it is all of the ads. I love this game that is my reason for four stars. Excellent game maybe less ads please?,4
Fun,4
I love the game,4
It's ok,4
It's an alright game,4
Fun,4
I think this game is really fun but I never play it unless I'm in the car without service so we don't have any ads,4
The game is fun basically supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,4
It's good,4
Very good app. But if I finish a level ads is running for 30 sec please fix it for online player if you play in offline no problem and the developer can give some extra challenges.,4
Fun game i like the among us ester egg for this game but why i rate this 4 because its a remastered of join clash 3d so if anyone did not play join clash 3d its a game like this so i hive this a 4/5.,4
Aside from annoying ads,4
"A really good game, is an offline game, but it can get SO LAGGY",4
Good game simple,4
It is okey Xxx,4
It is good but i didin`t like it much,4
Fun,4
Nice game idea,4
Good game,4
It's a really nice and fun game,4
Very easy. Could pass the time with this game. So far as I see.,4
Good game,4
"So i see a lot op people leave bad remarks about ads and i would just like to say ( you can play offline and not need wifi, i play offline so i dont see any adds... the only reason i don't rate this a 5 star is because when you get your amount over 400 people then the game glitzes and i must go out and restart the game ) good game tho to keep you busy when bored",4
If you get past the ads it's not a bad time killer it's like temple run but more units mix and match strategy with skill dodge traps and kill bosses the ads are there but using the ads as a revenue helps just keep this game alive and free too play I believe with some classic music this game could have real potential I'd endorse it if you would allow me to,4
Not a good game,4
Good game but there is a problem we can't buy 500 skin only But its a good game😀😀😀😀,4
really fun game just hate all the ads,4
Passes the time good,4

"Very cool game, didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like the fact that they force you to lose members on some endings. Entertaining though.",4
Good game but ads are too frequent.,4
Good,4
Its an ok game sucks that your group is so big get automatic losses on unavoidable hazards. Too many ads,4
Not bad so far,4
I like it an elevated degree 😃👍,4
"I can understand from a lot of users that ads are quiet annoying in this game.... Now I'm a super user, with AdAway installed, so this doesn't face me at all. Therefore I can say, from a pure game stand point; it's a good time consumer. If you just need to kill 5 or 10 minutes, this is definitely the game. If you need to kill 2 hours, this game will cause seasiurs😂. And if you're not an advanced android user, with a system wide AdBlock er, this game may cause a lot of anger",4
Amzing but to meny adds,4
Its a very good game but there is a lot of ads. Other than that though it is highley enjoyble.,4

It is nice but could add more features........,4

hi.good game,4
Over adds,4
SAMSUNG,4
I like it but there is ALOT of ads and its pretty slow dont u think.,4
"The ads that keep poppings ups (or for rewards) features were yes annoying, but this can be work around with. What make me most interested with this are the gameplay is 100% accurate as shown in the demo ads of it (were our count crash with opposing, and if they win they will dance). Thats all",4
This game is pretty fun but the ads and the glitches are annoying.,4
Good,4
I love this game,4
It was kind of good kind of broken but I like it,4
Nice and simple game but fun.,4
It is a fun game but quite hard! If you want a challenge then this is the game for you.,4

Cool but gets boring after a while...,4
DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This game is a good game but when you pay to get the ads removed they don't do it and just take your money. The contact details for the developer are incorrect and when you email them to try and sort the issue the wash their hands of it.,4
Good,4

Souly novel 1000 cuando to empiezas ta to guapo pero cuan toenee to es un Rollo 😑,4
I rated it's 4stars because I am not sure if it's fun or funless,4
fun game especially if you turn off mobile data and wifi to stop the ads but after playing for not very long i basically beat the whole thing. the level numbers still go up but at the end of most levels there is an obstacle that will kill half of the crowd regardless of how well you have played up to that point. there are very few attack mode levels. I had assumed once I had beaten all of the levels on the US map it would go to another country so you could progress and take over the world.,4
Simply addicting!,4
Very nice game,4
good but it can get boring,4
Es muy bonito y me gusta mucho jugarlo.,4
Fun to kill time,4
Not bad lah ads setiap masa huhu,4

Good game concept,4
Simplistic in early stages,4
"It's a really good game and time pass. I have it 4 stars because once my count goes above 250, the game starts to lag really bad. To all the complainers: Just turn your damn internet off and you won't get any ads 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄",4
Very good game.But very ads.😡خیلی تبلیغات داره,4

"(Updated review) the sound can be an issue for this app, I also have issues with being at a certain part in the game and it lags real bad and I lose at least 70% of my minions hehe. But other than that great game. Rating goes down from 5 stars to 4 stars",4
Cool,4
This app is quite good for curing my borem some days. I don't know why people are complaining about ads. TURN YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION OFF!!! You silly people 😂,4

"(I wish I could rate it a four and a half) This game has lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of adds. But I LOVE it. All I had to do is put my device on airplane mode, and kabam! All fixed! You can play this game anywhere like in the car, traveling and more places. I recommend this game. You can also just play Very quickly and then stop. You can earn skins too! It is a bit repetitive tho. All over all, I recommend this game to all y'all. Thanks for reading!!☺️☺️ Have a great day!!≤3 😉🤗",4
Fun but repetitious,4

"This game could've been better for the levels were very easy and they could've been more challenging. Although it's fun to play for a few days after installation but it comes out to be boring afterwards. In total, I'd prefer the levels to be more difficult to make it more interesting. : )",4

Waaaay too many ads. Other than that it's pretty fun,4
Quit interesting,4
"Changing my review to 4 star now that they fixed the ads. Still wish there was more to do with the coins and gems, but otherwise it's a fun game to pass the time.",4
Something different,4
"It is kinda fun, though not super challenging. There are also a lot of ads.",4
"Very addictive - absolutely love it. The only negative things are that the build and attck section is relatively easy to complete quickly and then it's just repetitive and you can't accomplish anything; and the ads - there's one after each level. Overall the game is very good, the ads don't really bother me and I would denifitely recommend",4
Wish there was an ad free version.,4
Good,4
I think it is fun,4
"Cute game. Fun to kill time, but like so many games, WAY too many ads!! Understand the need for greed, but come on, it's getting ridiculous among ALL games. We can tolerate it for a few times, but all too quickly become not worth the wasted time waiting for the ADS to quit after AEVERY play of the games. ADIOS, MUCHACHOS....",4
So. Many. Adds.,4
Fun so far,4
Wiooow,4
Ok,4

"Ads are a bit much, but it's a decent little timekiller.",4
Nice game but too many ads!,4
Good,4
"Yes, this game has a lot of ads, but not any more than any other app out right now. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't increase in challenge enough and once you finish the conquering the US map there is no where else to go. This game has a lot of potential, it just needs more development.",4
good,4
Fun,4
Nice 👍,4
Fun hate the ads,4
No sounds,4
Amazing game to be played only problem is to many advisement on the game is it can stop will wanna play every moment 😀,4
Good game to pass time,4
Too many ads... Any way to have a pay with no ads option ?,4
Not bad.,4
"Fun, but SOOOO many ads!!",4
I would have written it a five out of five but the game isn't that exciting it's something for me to do when I don't have anything to do so if you can download this game it's fun,4
So good game,4
Sfdxxz can you please i and uy,4
Not bad minus ad after every level,4
I like it,4
"I saw the ad while playing another game and the ad for this game is bad. I mean the ""person"" playing makes really bad choices that's my only problem for now",4
Funny,4
It's fun,4
A little glitchy,4
Same as the ads I saw and the ads in game is tolerable. Not bad.,4
Awesome,4
"Having so much fun while I'm watching a revolutionary war documentary. I'd like to think that those who are under 40 would watch these documentaries and learn what the United States of America is born out of. It is not a perfect political entity but it is an idea that will bring about, over many decades, a place of freedom and liberty that is without any superior in the world.",4
"Very fun, but a lot of ads.",4
Seems to be a lot better than the last time I played. Has more to do but going slow enough to see where you need to go. I think a lot of people are going to enjoy this version a lot better.,4
Nice,4
It's a good game but ads could be cut down a bit,4
Just okey,4
Good so far ease off on the advertising,4
its cool,4
"I also came here from the ads of this game .... In starting u will love it , but after sometime u will be bored of this game",4
Nice game,4
Nice game just the ads popping up after every level gets annoying. But understand its one of the ways the company generates revenue,4
A good time pass timer,4
I like everything except the ads,4
Good,4
Fun Game when your bored it gets you brain going 1 problem is I got 400 people and the game lagged REALLY Bad plz fix this,4
Ok,4
"I would rate 5 stars because I seriously love this game, a time killer really. But I didnt give the 5th star because of All. The. Ads!! Its super aggrivating and pauses my music so I have to turn it back on.",4
Just started. Lots of ads.,4
Nice game average good to pass time It would take 5 stars easily if the animations where a little bit better,4
"I really like and recomend this game, its cool and relaxing.",4
Fun for me at work,4
"Isn't a bad game to pass the time, but honestly, it's just not a game I wanna necessarily keep playing over and over is all.",4
Fun I,4
Loit,4
This games is very crazy i love this game i never delet this game i completed 300 levels 😍😍😍😍😍 this game is my brothers faverita game,4
Good,4
It's nice,4
Not crazy about all the extra ads but for some reason I love the game,4
Game is nice but it is so easy,4
I would of give this a 5 stars but the reason why I rated it a 4 star is that after every level there is a add and no one wants to see a add after every level so that's why I rated this a 4 star,4
Too many ads,4
Neat,4
Good game,4
Good,4
Well people say there is alot of ads but for me there is none at all so if u get ads then don't play but if there is none then do play it because it fun and takes out stress for me,4
Good math skills👍,4
Wow i love this game so much 🐤🐤🐹,4
When you have anger and you need to get it out I guess this game can help but you need to go offline,4

This game is really good but the lag for this game is not so good. When my little minion starts to attack one of the bosses it goes really glitch and I hate it when that happened please fix this.,4
Nice game,4
Obsessed. Fantastic.,4
I love this game for its amount of wonderful ads. I just enjoy watching them long one after another. It'd give a 5* if it wasn't for the annoying short breaks in between the ads to play the game ;),4
I don't like ads,4
Ok,4
"first level can actually be beat with the right choices, it's just quick math",4
"Great game, pretty addictive but got boring after level 50. Had an ad after every level but it wasn't much of a problem, it did get kind of annoying after a while as 80% of the ads we're unskippable, so I just turned on airplane mode. Neat little game, would recommend.",4
Omg people are going on and on about ads I mean only un patient people do this i hope people change there mind. And the male or female right under me i mean she or he is un patient!,4
Good but more ads,4
Great game 👍,4
Great time burner,4
I like it. Its simple,4
Good,4
Too many ads but otherwise it's good,4
Ok,4
Why is it lagging,4
The game is pretty fun! Just the main problem (like every phone game) is that there are so many ads. Practically an ad after each round and then you sometimes are to watch ads for rewards. The game those is pretty fun and is a nice way to burn time.,4
Fun time passer,4
Decent,4
Addictive just too many ads,4
Fun but too many ads.,4
Good 👍🏿,4
It's passing my daywithfunney,4
Fun and enjoyable but the ads are too many I spent more time watching them than playing,4
Way to many ad's.,4

I love this game but all the flipping ads are so annoying and also after every game there is a add and unless you are a add lover this is a good game but the actual game is brill,4

"I haven't played it yet, but all the comments are just about the adverts and it being a good ish game, bro just turn off your Internet before you go on the game",4
"It's ok and the ads can be avoided by turning off wifi, but still a bit glitchy.",4
Not bad good game,4
"This game matched the ad. I like the premise where you choose one of two options to increase your army to make it greater than the enemy's, and there are obstacles that can decrease your army further. I also enjoy the part of filling a ship that attacks other castles. What I don't like is that I can no longer spend the gems earned, & I cannot fully avoid some obstacles. Also, earning soldiers for attacking is too fast. Create more places to allow spending gems & places to attack.",4
"That's a great game. My little brother loves this game. but when you have a lot of people, game get stuck a lot .",4
Its fine just my brother deleted it but i got it back anyway soooooooooo ye and i love it now ye,4

Really good game but a bit boring. I had this game a day ago. But it was getting to boring for me. I uninstalled this game when I was bored.

Too many ads,4

I like this game. It helps me 2 stay on top of things! I just don't like ad breaks...,4
Fun game,4
Good game. I like this game. The one issue I have is that you always lose alot of your men to devices. You can only go left right as you go forward. You can slow your men or speed them up to avoid being caught by a device.,4
Better,4
Great game,4
Fun,4
I'll love to play this in my free time!,4
It's fun,4
Great but too many repetitive ads like most games. Atleast the ads are usually shorter.,4
Fun Different Unique,4
Killing time,4
"Fun, very fun actually. The only downside is the occasional necessary evil of ads.",4
Mast,4
It's fun,4
i play this game when i need to play math,4
It is really fun but i get annoyed when it keeps telling you to get diffrent chatacters but you don't want to. Also ads are a very annoying part of it. Though their isn't much . And it's not hard to lose on the levels because i think we all have brains. Otherwise 👍🏼,4
"Fun, and reasonable no. of ads",4
U ttyl,4
"Fun, mindless, perfect for when im trying to kill time with a simple easy to get into and not have to invest too much, but levels are only like 5 seconds long and ive gotten pretty familiar with the Coach Cory Wyane ads since i get one between each level.",4
Ita fun an addictive .. Auick u can turn it off and on .. U dont have ne there all day,4

Cool!!,4
Wow❤❤❤,4
Okay,4
"Fun time killer, but alot of ads",4
Way better than the arrow game; the runways arent the same and there's more challenge. Also you build islands. ***Ads trick: just exit out the game and tap right back on it. Makes the add disappear and leaves you right where you were.,4
Less ads and it would get 5 stars,4
Good gme,4
Cool,4
Not bad,4
Quick and fast paced. Good little game,4
Too many ads but decent otherwise 👌,4
Fun time burner,4

Guys main game ini ini tubklo lama tu pasti bingung terus konsentrasi yaa sama nii,4
Good game,4
I just love it but adds interupt wene you are on a level,4
Great game but they need to add more skins becaus I got all of them in one day and add different modes also make the game a little bit harder then it will be 5star,4
Super,4
It's just a casual game to play to be honest nothing boring but alright,4
I rated it a 4 because too many adds! Although fun.,4
Pretty ez,4
Enjoyable,4
Good...ads are too long And too often...takes over the game.,4

"Too many ads, but it's fun.",4
good play,4
Too many ads,4
"It's fun for a little while. The ads really aren't as prevalent as most reviews say. But the game loses almost all interest after you unlock all the skins (which is pretty fast). You also dont get to choose what color you are, it's selected by a wheel spin. If there were more goals or customization options, it'd keep the interest.",4
It is a good game 🙂...but it could be a bit more interesting and fun,4
I like this game but I hate all the adds so I'll rate it 4,4
Fun,4

"Thank you to the reviewer who said turn off Wi-Fi to stop ads, I suggest turning off mobile data too, I wasn't going to download this app until I saw that review & I haven't seen one advertisement all the time I've been playing this game which while very repetitive is also addictive, download it & play it with wi-fi/data off.",4
It's pretty good game to waste your time and you can play it offline too,4
This game whould be ok without all the adds,4

Tyoofojfk go k ho florist circles z,4
Just installed. Seems to be a lot of ads.,4
Good application,4
"Great game, and I have gotten used to the ads, but the only problem with this is that whenever I get about 300 people at the end it decreases that number to 220 or something, so I never get past X6.2 when the little people stack up, but other than that, great and super fun game. :)",4
The game would be awesome if it didnt lag and freeze so much it kinda kill the fun when u have to wait or start over,4
I like it but when I get about 250+ people it gets really laggy and is impossible to play,4
"There are kind of an overwhelming amount of ads, but if you disconnect from the wifi you can get rid of them.",4

"One of those he's that you play travelling or when bored .. it's good. But way to many ads , way to many. Some ads be ok but not after each 30 second round waiting for a 30 sec ad",4
Its a good game but it has no story or theme to it (just pointing that out) also there is alot of adds unless thats just me but the game its self is fun because you have to decide which one to do and dont get me wrong i just feel like that game should get like different themes or whatever but thats really all ihave to say,4
Good game but the ads are too frequent and not age appropriate ads (x-rated).,4
Really easy and fun!,4
Its a nice game but gets boring after a while because its just the same thing over and over again,4
I love all that you can pick any character you want when you get every character you can pick a bear anything but I rated it four stars because when you get a lot of the characters it's like you when you fight but I really really love it,4
Very nice game,4
Its good and fun,4
So good,4
"Lots of potential / concern on dev goals This game is quite fun, I've played till lvl. 50 so far. Pros: Original concept Good design Good diversity of obstacles Cons: Obstacles don't permit for more than +/- 150 soldiers to get through. Kinda takes away the fun of seeing huge crowds! Has so much potential expansion but worried that the devs only see this as a cash grab given the amount of ads..",4
Turn off WiFi so you won't get Ads..but it does get boring after 30 Levels..otherwise it's a good time killer^^,4
Okay,4
N/a,4
good game but to agree with the masses to many ads,4
I like this game.It makes me work my brain for the maths equations to get the highest number to win!,4
Too many ads!!!,4
An amazing game I have told so many friends about it and its very good tomolay when your bored or have no wifi!!,4
I enjoy this game very much...,4
It's fun to play but you drive me crackers with ads and I end up either turning it off or throwing my phone 📱 at the wall until I smash it ot bits I do understand you do it for the money but come on really so many ads I feel like ripping my hair out until I look like an alien 👽it pisses me off that much its as obvious as a man getting kicked in the balls having his eyes 👀 pop out of his head and replaced with his testicles and then expecting to walk home have sex with his wife without pain,4
Pretty fun. Just turn off wifi and data and you won't get any ads,4

"This game is not that bad at all! Sure the ads are just ridiculous, but you can simply turn off your mobile data or go into airplane mode! This game literally is what the ads show and I'm happy about it!",4
"Not bad, a bunch of ads tho..",4
Sorta fun,4
"Eh, it's ok a for a time passes but the ads are just a little too much.",4
Some what entertaining,4
Nice,4
Surprisingly fun,4
This is the best game 🎮 but there are so much adverse that's why I gave 4star,4
"Appears mindless fun, loads is ads",4
Nice game 👍👍,4
Like the game. Lot's of ads,4

It is quite satisfying casual game and a entertaining and slightly maths based game with challenges. There is a bug where the game get stuck when I reach population above 200 or so.,4
you shake your butt at that big guy,4
Its fun if ur not stupid,4
I like this game a lot very addictive just each level same as the last it doesn't get harder and harder.,4

Ehh its 👌 🆗️ I guess,4
Good have fun,4
Easy fun game,4
تبلیغات زیاد داره,4
It's a good quick game to play. I don't know if there are anymore islands to build on but it would be nice otherwise it seems a bit redundant to get gems!,4
It good,4
I wish you could add like more obstacles to the game that would make it more interesting.,4

Ok kool,4
"Great fun , long advertising",4
Maybe having the ability to change the formation or stop or go back so they can go through some of the obstacles without losing half of the pack. And my village is built and that's it. And why can't I watch the attack? 😃,4
Enjoyable too many adds more than usual,4
Really cool game but way too many ads. The high amount of ads is the only thing that kept it from being five star,4
I like this game that all i can say,4

Fun but you have to be strategic,4
"Alot of ads but very fun...... my daughter is glaring at me right now waiting for a turn, wishing she never showed it to me!!",4
"Hi there. I found glitches when you have over 200+, please fix this problem. Also when you get to the ""steps"" with 200+, please update so that the count (4.2; 5.4) go beyond 6.2 ? One more, the ""building part"", i have 5000+ diamonds and can't use them. Please update this part too. Thanks.",4

Good it's just the ads made it worse,4
It's good but kinda boring.,4
This game so easy and hard,4
Seems like a really cute game. Not too many adds. The only problem I've had so far is that the numbers are not very high contrast. I can't see them very well.,4
I had given the game 4 stars because it lags,4
"The game itself is good and is intertaining, but after every run there is an ad that you have to watch before you can move on.",4
Very fun,4
Amazing yet thrilling 👏👏👏,4
Mind blowing,4

"When I used to play this game, this game used to give me a lot of pleasure but I used to enjoy playing this game the most when the player population in it is huge but those paths are so thin in the game that in the game It is impossible to take more than 200 players till the last line so I just gave it ,4 stars,Whenever the problem is solved, on that day I will give five stars.",4

Fun aside from ads between each run,4
Santhos you can see the point,4
"The game is good. You can stop the ads by turning off the intarnet, but the problem is the levels are way to short and there is nothing interesting. The game is repeats itself all the time. I have completed 77 mission but the game is never get harder or anything else. I mean, the game is needs to be developed.",4

"Decent game, relatively easy. I read the reviews beforehand and saw that most of the complaints about the excessive amount of ads. So, being an intellectual, when I played the game I turned on airplane mode. If you do this, the game is quite enjoyable.",4
Fun game. Played 42 levels straight through with ZERO ads. Turn your mobile data off,4

So far pretty fun,4
Mabye this game can be better if it was with more different colors🎨. And with clothes👗👚👖 but anyway I love❤ it😍. I don't care. So I give 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.,4
This game is entertaining.....for a while. There is nothing to it. You move your guys left and right to avoid obstacles and increase the number of your guys. The ads are not that bad. There is an island to build on and upgrade. But there is no real challenge to the game. But this version of the game is far better than Mob Control.,4
Cool game,4

Cool time killer,4
Easy and fun game,4
"Pretty good but in the ad,you can multiply 20x and we get 3x. Other than that pretty good 4 stars.",4
Bad app not installed in my phone,4
Good,4
This game is good but it includes so many ads...and this should be upgraded more soon....otherwise this game is an wonderful game 🎮 👏.....and after solving these problems this game should get 5 stars thats why I am not giving it a 5 star but I hope it will get better soon so I could give an 5 star to it...........🥰,4
Super,4
☹️🙂☹️,4
Let the fun begin,4
Bruh you care about ads just close your WiFi your good,4
Alright,4
Awesome!,4
"So far, it's a very fun game. It has only been a day, but I do enjoy it.",4
A few ads in between levels but otherwise pretty good,4
"I give it four stars because they can make the game more interesting and more levels they are the same levels, please improve on that, but it is still a nice game 🤔👍",4
"Eh its aight, can get a bit glitchy and laggy witch sometimes makes it hard too play.",4
"So far so good, update later",4
Kinda fun,4
I give this app a 4 because it is fun but there is just way to many ads. The amount of ads they have are CRAZY. Buy it is still fun to play it is cind of interesting but with all the ads not so fun😀hope u enjoy,4
Passes the time,4
Ok,4
Quite fun,4
Too many ads,4
Cool K,4
Pretty good game but more graphics should be added,4
its a very good game. you get a vey big number. and win,4

I Love this game,4
خوب بود,4
Nice,4
Great game to play for relaxation but too many pop up ads,4
This is very good 👍👌😊👌😊😊👍👍👌👌 game,4
It's very nice but it jammed maybe for me,4
"It's okay so far, but it is to early to really know.",4
I came from ring id community job..and install this game..and i can say this is fun,4
nice game but lots of ads,4
"A fun game, but the frequent adverts are annoying.",3
Tr,3
Repetitive,3
Its a koo lil game but theres way 2 many ads takes 4ever 2 get back 2 the game,3
If u have to many people than well it glitches and you can't fight them and you just keep walking into them but u get no were and you don't fight them. ( them meaning the red team),3
This games is good great,3
"Lags are a lot! A time-killer game and it becomes boring as soon as you play it for an hour or so, still these games are meant to be click-bait but this one is true to its ads so will give an extra star for it",3
Omg,3
"I liked this game. It is very mathematical, so it's not making you a totally veggie brain.",3
The app is really good I really enjoyed the game but somehow the game gets stuck when we got high score this is kinda annoying and it has like a lot of adds I would suggest to turn off ur wifi or data,3
This game's pretty fair.,3
The game is fun but the reason why I am giving it 3 stars is that it stucks alot and it has a lot of ads....... U have to see an ad after each and every level 😤😤,3
Its a pretty fun game but the ads ruin it. We get an ad after EVERY map. Its irritating and im deleting the game because of it.,3
This game is so easy to play,3
Kind of lagy,3
Not so good..,3
It's not better,3
"this game is good and it's good for your skills but there is ADS every time you die or finish. You have a 30-10 second ad, please fix this.",3
Fun but im playing those games without internet connection so those ads won't come every 7 seconds,3
"So far so good! Ok, now that I've had a chance to play more of this game, I have to say....""You earn all these little peeps running around and the game makes sure you lose over half of them!!!!"" I'm tired of that!!! I am taking stars away and uninstalling....",3
"Too many adds, otherwise fun.",3
Idk what to think,3
There's an ad literally after every level.,3
Well it's a bit glitchy.And sometimes it won't let you pick the answers you want! Smh 🙃,3
i like the game. Its really fun to me but it is very laggy and keeps killing my stickmen. no it is not my wifi because i had this game for a while and it never worked right*,3
"Good game, potentially. But the ads between each level, last longer than the game which spoils it. Uninstalled.",3
It the best game but ....... the ads i hate it 😡,3
It's a cool game it's just needs to more configured. It will make all the people go to one direction but your finger is one the opposite side of the screen.,3
Good,3
It not best game ever so that is gust my opinion,3
Not much to it. Just repetitive levels with different stuff changing each round. I kinda wish theres online. Ads are fine just turn on airplane mode lol.,3
Lagging,3
Gg in the overall could use more techniques to be more entertaining <3 but i found that its size is 171Mo not 58Mo so pls fix it .,3
Fun game. Ads are too long. 15 seconds of game play with 30 second ads in between,3
good,3
Nice,3
"Fun, with too damn many commercials.",3
"Slow start, but engaging",3
Better Game,3
Too many ads,3
Repetitive,3
Bohat had,3
"Great game really fun, a bit heavy on the ads to be honest ( 2 heavy, lvl complete add,apply skin,add,beat a boss,add, do anything followed by add. ) The 3 box extra reward being an add it's perfect, every 5/10 lvl completion = 1add sound reasonable. If you can bare the afass 5star app",3
"THE game concept is very unique, but ads are there are after every level, so when I started the playtime was less and and time was more.",3
"Its alright, i just hate it how they throw ads in your face, and ive been getting a lot. I even turned off my internet to see if it worked but nothing happened. I get it that they need to raise money but it gets out of hand sometimes.",3
Too many ads,3
"This game is quite alright to start with. However it is very repetitive and all the levels are pretty much all the same when you get so far. They're doesn't seem to be any further progress I can make now with building the city, I've expanded as far as it seems possible and that didn't take long. You are rewarded diamonds for progress although their doesn't seem to be anywhere or anything to use or exchange them. Also too many ads unless you turn off WiFi and data on your device.",3
I really loved the game the reason i gave it a three stars because of the pop up ads.,3
The concept is really good. However theres way too many ads. That take up most the game.,3
"Relatively fun and straightforward, but wow, the ads. I'd say a level takes about 15-20 seconds to complete, and each is followed by an ad that may be double that time. Some are skippable but there's currently one for a crypto site and one for some kind of bingo thing and together these took up much more of my time than the game did. For the record I'm someone who doesn't mind ads in principle, but these are just disproportionate.",3
Good,3
Best game,3
Add are killing the fun,3
Downloaded this to play along with my son .. Yet his has more choice of skins i only have 1 page where he has 2 yet it is exact same game?,3
its fun but then it gets boring and its very easy,3
"Waaaay too many adds, but fun and almost worth the inconvenience.",3
there is alothe of adds,3
Super,3
Ok game but way way too many ads,3
"Seems like it could be fun enough, but too many ads",3
deez nuts,3
❤❤,3
Fun but it doesn't really go anywhere. And what are the diamonds for?,3
"Bwesit, bat diko ma install?!",3
Thank you pat is not cool,3
Is game so best amazing I Like,3
"Great game. Great fun, easy to learn but shame about the ads. I know they need ads to finance more games but it's a bit ridiculous. Pass a level first time you have 10s of game and 30s of ads. The ads are not intrusive on game play but between each level. Wouldn't mind 5s ads with the odd 30s, but each one 30s?",3
Good,3
"Best at first, but boring day by day. Because the situation is same",3
Great fun game. Could see myself spending alot of time on it but the constant ads ruin it. each game play is 30 seconds or less and there is an ad video after every round.,3
Nice😁,3
"The game is fun, but there are too many ads and its frustrating",3
Way too many ads,3
"I was in mid installing and than I read in the comments about the 30 seconds ads, so I cancelled the installation.",3
Damn the ads,3
Nice 🌟 👌 🤟🏼 ✨,3
Enjoy the game but far too many adverts. May end up deleting for this reason as every game then an advert is tiresome.,3
Fun but gets repetitive,3
Bad,3
I would rate it 5 stars but after every round I have to watch an advertisement and I hate it,3
Nope And Dope At The Same Time,3
This game is lots of fun and great for younger kids especially if there learning multiplying great but negative two stars for the adds every 10 seconds!!!!!!!🙄🙄,3
Gets boring,3
"Can be fun for a little while, but just too many ads...",3
They give me the same score nomatter what I get,3
Ads are annoying,3
(E3 3D Updt),3
"Turned data off to prevent the adverts, managed to complete the entire game and all zones in 3 hours of play in one afternoon. Disappointed to see no other zones in different continents etc!",3
Good game but i cannot work out what the gems are used for? I know the coins are used for upgrades etc but after launching attacks etc i have loads of gems and no idea how to use them. Please help!,3
Laggy adds are anooying but other then that good app,3
Not bad but not good ever,3
Boring,3
good game but after 200 people my mobile is hanging,3
Way too many ads.,3
Ok& good,3
"I really like this game, and would like to give it 5 stars, but there are too many ads. I'd be willing to pay a few bucks yearly to play without ads. Why is this not an option?",3
This app is good,3
Alright game. HOWEVER i had to uninstall as there was too many Ads. Theres a long Ad after every level.. No thanks,3
What do we do with diamonds when we finish to build on the island? Why do we still collect them?,3
Like this game but a little less more ads,3
Enjoyed played it...,3
"Fun to a degree, but get repetitive and boring before long. At least it's a game where its ads match gameplay. Ads in the game can get obtrusive.",3
This game is really fun and really cool for kids but I don't get why there is an ad for each round it's annoying at first I thought it was a glitch so I restarted my phone and it was still doing it so I just delete it the game that's why I gave this game a 3 star,3
It's a nice game 🎮 but I advise you not to play it with data because it will finish it on ads and if WiFi it will waste your time on ads,3
Good game,3
It's just full of ads and even when my WiFi is perfectly fine it's all glitchy,3
Way too many ads.,3
Bobo ka tangina mo,3
It's alright it a pass time,3
I recommend who has ad problem. If you turn off your mobile data when playing(if it's possible😀😀) it doesn't show ads. Interesting game.,3
Fun but yall already know commercials for days,3
A bit too many ads,3
Adds too frequent,3
Glitchy,3
Very limited,3
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🤣🤣🤣🤣,3
it dosen't let us use the key board or mouses!,3
Fun but a lot of ads,3
OK with an adblocker. I don't like that there's no way to speed up or slow down through obstacles and some of them are timed so you WILL lose almost all of your pieces. Frequent bottlenecks mean you never really go past the 5.8 bonus. Would've been nice to hit the top of even see some progression past that.,3
I would give it a 5 but too many ads just to play the game no thanks sorry not trying to be mean it's just I hate ads,3
See Yy,3
Good,3
Would be five star if it wasn't rigged to lose a bunch of figures. The tracks are not wide enough to avoid being hit.,3
Fun but ads are annoying,3
Me it was a good game till it just froze after the ad when I got done watching for the gift box,3
Freya's,3
Cool game i like everything anout this game the edition .But u should kind if quit the wiered adss dude those ads too many,3
Is a bell game but un po fa schif,3
Good game ads are annoying,3
Doesn't work well but fun,3
I like the game yes it is good but TO MUCH ADS,3
"It's... Average, There's definitely more it could do, but also it's literally a game on my phone, not an AAA title",3
Not bad,3
To many ads,3
Good but it could use some improvements it's not that fair for my opinion Just saying 😺,3
Good game,3
Woo woo so nice,3
Love it hate the ads,3
Fun game,3
"I do agree that there are too many adds, but honestly its an pretty good app. A lot of people are giving the people who made this game a hard time, but I'm sorry that they are just being nice to create a nice simple fun game.",3
"It's ok, but the ads or js not it",3
"Three..for ads and glitches. Really love playing .but sn ad after ever level, glitches where I lose my guys. Keeping it for now but it may eventually be uninstalled.",3
Fun game but the ads kill it theirs one after every lvl and their long ads about 20 seconds at least,3
"The game is fun but the ads are ridiculous. Too long, too many. I know games have to make money but with these numbers you're pushing it too far and putting people off. (Not only you, it's a recurring theme in here these days)",3
Kalam game hai,3
"It glitches something ones, but is very fun. (I recommend playing offline) 8/10.",3
"Could be more fun if there was music, and less ads.",3
"This is the usual Too-Many-Ads type of game. Turn your wifi and data off to play it, or it'll be no fun. Personally, I find this game repetitive and boring~ same content, different level. They get points for being very accurate in their ad campaigns, though. The videos match their game, which many developers can't even manage to do. 3.5/10",3
Only 3 because its not landscape,3
Nice but many ads,3
Nice but,3
This is good 👌👍,3
Good experience,3
Too many ads,3
"Game is ok, ads are longer than the game. I spent a total of about 20 seconds to complete the first 5 runs to level up. In that time, i had more than 2 minutes of ads. Uninstalled due to extremely long ads.",3
In the add it times not adds,3
I liked it for a few weeks but it soon got boring,3
😎,3
Nice,3
It won't let me usemy S-pen,3
Not bad so far,3
Its fine its just it is a bit to easy,3
"It's like every other game you've played like this. Unlocked all the characters in... no lie, 30 minutes. Doing the same thing over & over. Don't get me wrong,It's fun. But it wears off quick!! 3/5",3
"A reasonable game, there are a few glitches though. One of them is whenever it gives you rewards you only get one, you can watch a video to get two others. But when I the video to get another prize, they told me I had to watch the video again to get the prize. So I did. But it kept just telling me how to watch a video before I got the prize. Overall I basically just play this game when I'm bored and I need something to do. It's not a game you likely get addicted to.",3
Supar,3
decent for idle time...,3
"A good game, its easy if you have passed 4th grade but very repetitive",3
Fun to many adds,3
it was fun but it was glichy otherwise I love it,3
Boring after a few levels,3
Sarasa,3
Good. For me,3
"I love this game so much but the ads are very annoying tho but still cool. I also think u should add a few more things to this game, like new skins, new maps and some colors to choose from. So my rate is 3 stars but still keep the good work up!! From : Jen P.S my hands hurt 🥲",3
A lot ads hufffttt,3
"I like it very much, but, the levels are too short to enjoy it, two or three challenges in the level. That makes is boring and takes out all the fun that can be added to the game",3
"Great game, wish it was ad free though... too many ads for every move!",3
Overall decent game.,3
Too many ads,3
Too many ads,3
Cool,3
.mini. i. K kk m,3
Please STOP ads,3
I like it just there is a lot of ads,3
"OMG too many ad. Play 10 sec, ad 30 sec",3
Fun but DRAINS my battery I have a 6000MAh battery and in 2 minutes it drains 2%,3
Its nice,3
Nice game,3
I like this game alot but it's a bit laggy and sometimes the app closes by its self. I'm not sure if it's just my device.,3
New fun recommendation for time killing ability,3
"I like this game, but I had to give this 3 stars because of ads, if there were no ads I would give it 4 stars",3
Awesome,3
"There's not too much to complain about; in my experience there wasn't too many ads but to be fair, the game gets boring fast. It was fun for a bit and then it just gets old. It's the same process every level. There's maybe a new roadblock every few levels but you'll feel like you're playing level one every time.",3
Boring and not much to do in game.,3
This game is so smooth,3
Good Play But It's Free Play Time,3
It would be a great game if there weren't so many ads! They're jam packed in there!,3
This game has way too many ads!!!,3
Pruthvi gamer,3
Boring 🙃,3
This game feels like a social expirement 🤨,3
Ads kill the game it's way to many and happen in the middle of game play,3
There is to much adds Plus please stop getting people to spend money 💰 on the game I also do not no why it is slow,3
Really fun and easy to spend time on. But it has too many ads. You get a 30 seconds Ad after a 10 seconds gameplay.,3
I don't like it I'm in a good looking for good games so I give this 3 stars,3
It's one of those games you play when you're bored and just want to pass the time. It's pretty fun. I wish I could get an ad free version because half the time you're watching ads instead of plying.,3
Is there a way to pay for no ads? They do get old fast.,3
"Good time waster. I just wish there was more to strive for and there was more level verity. Not a bad game, but definitely one to play on a long trip or air plane.",3
"Good concept, but not much gameplay, gets boring after a short time, and GOSH the amount of ads is horrifying.",3
Too many ads,3
Ok I guess,3
Fun but too many ads,3
Good concept but gameplay is too short. Way too many ads for me. If it had less ads would get five stars,3
Engaging,3
It's an all right game,3
I like this game and so many fun,3
Needs more skins,3
Sometimes it glitches,3
"The ads are at least realistic to the app, but it just couldn't hold my attention. Plus, ads after every single level... Yegh",3
Good game but far too many ads so deleted. Spent more time watching ads than playing game,3
"it's ok but I really want you to know that when I play it always glitches better off downloading it again and I f you want to know the best games are fortnite , Roblox and tic tok idk but i hope this helped you xx from summer",3
"Amazing games, too many adds",3
Too many ads,3
خوبه بد نیس,3
"This game is addictive, but no matter how many guys I have it's hard to get to the top. I really love this game still!",3
It's fun,3
"Game is good, could be better if the game play is a bit longer, adds also need to slightly get removed but if you turn ur internet off you get no adds. I say this game is a 3 out of 5",3
Fun for a while if you play offline. Other than that an ad machine.,3
Ads,3
Lots of ads but a very fun game. Can be very VERY glitchy,3
Too much adds,3
"I mean, it's awesome, but there's an ad every single time we finish just one level, and see no icon to remove them even by paying.",3
Game would be fun an addicting if everything about the game didn't just lead to another ad🤮,3
Good game but it has some mistakes😁😉😉,3
Countmastersstickma,3
*_Too many adds_* But it is a fun game to play if you are bored or have nothing to do please fix the bugs thanks :From #,3
Nothing extraordinary about this game. Too many ads.,3
Too much ads,3
Add some more free features on the game and make the game more challenging.,3
It's alright,3
Too many ads,3
"If there are lots of ads, urn off your Internet, silly",3
Love the game but adds are the problem!,3
"Good game, way too many ads",3
Takes too much time to downlod thats why 3 star rating.,3
It's okay I have ads,3
It ok 🙄,3
It's a fun game but there are too many ads,3
I like the game. Give an option to purchase without ads. I play on airplane mode because there are way too many ads.,3
It's an ok game but there are too many ads and the performance isn't the best.,3
Entertaining,3
There are so many ads!,3
3.5 stars I would rate,3
Nice game. Getting really bored though. Worst thing is the bombardment of ads. Like really annoying,3
Nice app,3
"It's ok, but its many pop up ads with this game",3
"Thid is a fun game and a good time waster, but there are too many ads and the game starts lagging after I reach 200 stick people.",3
Very Nice,3
It is a amazing game the only reson i gave it a three is because it glitigs all the time and of all theadds,3
"Fun game, WAY too many ads. Literally a 30 sec add after each level. Ruins it.",3
"It's good for when you just need to turn off your brain. I don't think there's much in the way of advancing, or if there is advancement it's gradual. I'm on level 147, so super gradual. Ads are plentiful and long, at times you feel like you are spending more time ignoring ads than playing.",3
This game is way too easy for mr persnly,3
A time passer.,3
Love playing this game!!!!,3
"Great Game, but ALOT of Ads",3
Is fun,3
Its very fun but quite laggy!,3
Super,3
It glitched a lot and made me mess up,3
Nice game 😊😊😊,3
Way too many ads.,3
The Ads ARE EXTREMELY STUPID it really slows down my chromebook :P,3
"Too many ads, but better than not getting your prizes.",3
On entertaining for about 5 minutes,3
"Ads after every level 🙁, addictive but boy that's ads really add up.",3
Good,3
"A whole lot of Number Reducers. What's the point of gathering as many people as you can, if they're going to do to an avoidable sawblade, spiketrap, or pit? Stupid game.",3
far too simple,3
Good,3
it not to bad,3
Fun games but waaaaay too many ads and too long of ads.,3
I just got it and it's very easy if you know math. Like me,3
Good fun,3
Not to bad,3
"Exactly as advertised (ragdoll figures fighting with each other). But, exactly as expected, lots of ads.",3
too many ads,3
EVERY SINGLE LEVEL COMMERICAL,3
"The ads are a bit too frequent to know what is going on, but otherwise it is a really fun math game!",3
To long to load but it was a satisfaction of a game 🎮 😌 :],3
It gets laggy when many of those tiny creatures.,3
Its slow,3
"After you take over the US, you can't atack anymore. SO MANY ADS!",3
Awesome,3
Nice game 😃😃,3
The game is hard to get,3
Kkjjjn. Mopeds. f,3
The game is awesome... ☺️ But it would be nice if we can use diamonds after full land is built ..... It will be useful if the diamonds are used to buy skins or any helmet type protective things .... So that we can enjoy the game more ☺️,3
Stop rating 1 or 2 stars and I hate that Eval 1 to 2 Ok,3
STOP TALKING ABOUT THE ADS THE GAME IS NOT EVEN SHOING ME ADS INPLUS THE ADS ARE NOT EVEN BILT IN THE GAME the girl that wasent even talkig about the ads is rite she was saying its to ez,3
Not bad !,3
Yeah Counting Is The Easiest Way To Play Haha,3
Fun game but too many ads.,3
It is a interesting game ❤,3
Ok game,3
The game is wonderfu 👌👍l but the Ads Are Irritating..😩❌,3
Hgfh Fis,3
It's a fun concept of a game. But there are so many ads. It takes away from the fun of the game. Not worth it unfortunately,3
Too many adds,3
Kinda fun but not really challenging. Not if you know what numbers are and which one is bigger than the other.,3
Aint terrible just ads,3
Way to much ads but it's good to be offline,3
Fun game but the ads is too much. You spwnd more time watching ads than actually playing the game.,3
Game is good not great ads are a bit too much simple concept but works would like a zen mode or something of such,3
Nice,3
Cute game but way too many advertising. Could not play for than 15 minutes. Got so irritated,3
Meh,3
It was ok,3
3 star's 😒,3
"It's okay, but you get an ad literally after each and every 30-second round. Obviously some ads are expected in a free game, but the ad/play ratio isn't worth it.",3
It's relaxing but too many advertisements.,3
Kinda boring,3
"there were lots of ads in my opinion it was kinda a bit boring but I thought it was weird that my notification said to ""destroy your enemy NOW"" with the caps also...Pretty sus...... jk",3
It is pretty boring sometimes doing the sane thing. Each level is pretty similar,3
This game is quiet good but the only thing fussing me is the stupid ads,3
To much ads so I give it 3,3
Lots of adds but they don't bother me. What's annoying is I haven't even hit level 200 yet and have run out of goals. I have basically beaten the game. The levels are just the same thing over and over again. I have conquered america and have nothing left to use my jewels on. Boring. Too easy.,3
Thank,3
Game is what it looks like. Three rounds was enough fun. Game time is about equal to advertisement-watching time.,3
💟,3
"I do enjoy the game itself. It is so much fun. And I do understand that we need ads for sponsoration etc,but do we really need that much of them? I only gave a 3 star,because the amount of the ads,because it's really ruin the fun factor. In my opinion, it would be really good, if we only would need to watch ad's for example if we want to unlock a character or make more money in the game, and not after each level,in a way I can't even skip them. Thank you! :)",3
Pro,3
I think that this game is Really cool ..But 1 problem THERE ARE ADS POPPING UP EVERY MINUTE!!!!! I CANNOT STAND IT!! but if you remove the ads i will give you 5 stars😋😁 😇,3
It is good game and fine.,3
I like the concept but the game stays the same. You don't level up???,3
ADS,3
"Seems like fun just started playing I'll let you know if it doesn't bore the hell out of me in a week or so, thanks WildMAN",3
Make aure your comnection is 100% solid or you will have freezing issues. Besides that this would be a good learning tool for mathmatics.,3
Basic game easy to play and fun sometimes frustrating but that comes with the level of my playing ability,3
I think should upgrade this game,3
It is Good,3
Not bad,3
"This would be a 5 start game for me of there weren't as many ads. But I couldn't even find a way to remove them. Other than that, it's been a lot of fun and a great distraction! If having to wait & close out of an ad after EVERY level doesn't annoy you then I definitely recommend playing!",3
"Fun but repetitive, wayy too many ads, maybe if there weren't as many ads I would give it 4 or 5 stars",3
not bad,3
Mama,3
Games never stop nobody 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😅😅😅😅😅😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺😁😁😁😁😁😁😁,3

PT,3
Meh. To many ads,3
👌👌,3
"This game is good. But now, iam going to play ▶️ this game 🎮 for first time ⏲️ so I think this game is amazing but see what happen ????????",3
"Mostly ads... It's a bit of a scam in the sense that they made it physically impossible to get over a certain score at the end of regular levels as the level does not provide you enough room to get any more units through to the end, so it forces you to progress at a set rate cap or less... Very repetitive...",3
Imi merge in lag pe calculator dar pe telefon nu.,3
its ok,3
Cool 😀,3
50/50,3
Fun fact: you can turn off your internet to stop the ads,3
It is a very bad.l will not play it again 😓,3
"Maybe in the next update expand it besides the United States, to globally. If it just the US then I already completed it and not that fun anymore.",3
It's so easy☹️,3
"Gets boring as time goes on, but good all in all.",3
"Hi... Everyone would rate this game 5 stars, but now people are saying that this game has too many ads. First I thought that there wont be that many ads, but when I installed this game, 100% people are right! WHY THERE ARE SO MANY ADS??!! Why the comments are for?? Well, of course for saying whats good in the game and whats not!!!...If so many people are writing the same, that there are too many ads, why are you ignoring them?! THERE ARE TOOOOO MANYYY ADS!!!! I'm uninstalling this ''ad game""now!",3
It's a good app,3
Fun,3
Not bad,3

keep going through big gold don't died because there is many reds,3
"The game is great, but I give it three stars because: 1. It's installing too long. 2. There are so many ands in every single level.",3
"Its fun to play if you are bored but the map to take over is the USA only which must mean the country this was developed in hates the USA clearly. You can skip ads by minimizing and reclicking the app icon again not your opened app side scrolling list. If you try this it skips over the ad. It works for word trip, zen match, and solitare and probably many more. Im surprised no one ever tried this. But yeah the game play doesnt increase in difficulty and rarely is a challenge and its never ending.",3
Good,3
খেলা টি অনেক ভাজে একটি খেলা,3
It is not bad just before you play turn off WiFi and mobile data. Solves the problem with the adds.,3
awesome,3
Guys Yall are saying Dont Install this Game Full of Ads do yall have a Brain Ever heard of turning the Wifi Off?,3
Fun,3
Twas cool kinda confusing sometimes Maybe I'm just dumb idk,3
I would literally pay for an ad free version. So many ads its ridiculous..,3
Entrenst,3
Too much advertising,3
It's a nice game indeed,3
Its fun but tooo many ads...more time dealing with ads than playing the game,3
"To many ads, would be a great game otherwise.",3
it's much better because there's no ads,3
"Fun, but too many ads. App sometimes freezes after ad, too.",3
Its alright,3
Gameyatidaseru,3
Yeah I think I agree with everyone on this and there is just so many ads and literally I can't take it anymore.the game is pretty fun though I only like downloaded this like a few days ago well as I said the gami fun and all but there is just to many ads.it would be better if you could change all of the ads then that would be way better 😁😁😁😁😁,3
"Looks like a fun game, but watching ads taking more time then playing. Uninstaled because to many ads..",3
Too many ads,3
"Fun for a while, low replay value.",3
"Kinda fun, but there are WAAAY too many ads. Literally one for every single level and every other is a full un-skippable ad.",3
"I'd say it's deserving of three stars, but no more. It gets boring and repetitive, and also way too hard and too challenging. I recommend Super Stylist or Egg, Inc.",3
Not the best game in the world,3
zuufujiw I get home I don't know if I have a clue how to the right place to the house 🏘️ even know how to do a clue how I feel when to make,3
Gets unremitting after a month,3
I think it looks nice Fight club,3
"Too many adds, way too many adds. Fun game otherwise.",3
Short adds and some tricky game play for kill a couple of seconds of boredom.,3
"I started with 20 characters, hit the 5x multiplier at the start, and it gave me only 80. It should've been 100.",3
When u go above 200 ppl it lags a lot other than that good game,3
This too much ad,3
"Nice little game, but way too many adverts",3
ok,3
I like this game. This is my favorite,3
Ok,3
realeboga Dlamini,3
Is a good game,3
Good,3
3 because it has too many adds after each level,3
Too many ads they want our feedback but don't want to update the game to no ads unless the company they advertising for is giving them huge amount of Dollars,3

Good game,3
It pauses sometimes and when I let .y hand go it keeps on running,3
"TOO MANY adverts, it becomes annoying quickly.",3
Meh!,3
If you want to play these type of games peacefully without ads just turn off your data 😂😂,3
Ads ruin it.,3
Nice but too many ads,3
Ok,3
The games is good just to many ads,3
"Great game, ads every 5 seconds does my head in though",3
Its just average. There is nothing more to it. I like the different levels and the quality is not bad. It's just your standard moble game.,3
Liked the game. Erased had to erase it on the first day too much ads.,3
Ok,3
"The game itself it simple and engaging. The amount of ads completely distracts from the game, they occur so frequently you are watching more ads than you are actually playing. Otherwise it would have earned 5 starts.",3
Game is good but hangs when Number goes more than 250,3
This game is good but not so interesting 🥺😏😏......👎👎,3
Ok,3
To much ads,3
"Fun, but tons of ads",3
Is fun game way too many ads,3
Njeeeehh 🥱🥱🥱,3
This app is great for kids,3
Us,3
"Way to many adds. Turn off data , no more adds .",3
It stupidly fun,3
ကောင်းသား,3
Ok,3
This game is a fun time killer with easy controls. I really want to play the game... Why can't I get rid of ads? I'll pay for it! There is an ad after every level... I spend more time watching then playing.,3
"This game is very nice but When the number of people increases, the game breaks down and your people are killed by obstacles",3
"a quirky and fun little game. a lot of fun to play for a short while but lack of variation makes it get old very fast. Making it 3d also makes the game needlessly demanding and adds nothing to the game. Download it, install it and play it, have fun and move on. You'll remember the game fondly.",3
O.o koo transfer :-)$#100000000,3
Lotsa ads but good game to pass time.,3
Nice,3
Too many ads and their long too. However if u turn on airplane mode all ads are disabled. Other than that a unique playing game.,3
"Its ok, especially when Internet is off (so no ads) but its not very well optimised, when you start reaching 200 troops your group will be so big that traps and pits will be unavoidable for a chunk of your group. Still overall a decent time waster.",3
Fun concept but levels are too short and ads after every level gets annoying because it's so frequently.,3
It's a simple and entertaining game. But the only way to play it without getting insane is offline. Too many adds every single time.,3
"The adds are pretty bad, otherwise it would be a fun game.",3
When I was new in this game it was fun now it is Boring I only play for 1-2 level and done because THERE ARE TOO MANY ADS!,3
Ft,3
There are a lot of ads and I don't understand why well I do now why ads are there because that want u too see wat app there is and downloaded it and play or buy stuff or sell stuff,3
More time spent watching commercials than playing the game.,3
To much ads,3
It would be a really fun game if you could play a few levels before ads come.,3
"An ad after every level? It wouldn't bother me if there was a pay version. Otherwise, it's a fun game!",3
Too many ads,3
Too much Ads,3
I rate this a 3 star because there are to many adds,3
"Good game, but alas taken off my device due to an ad after EVERY game",3
I lick him .....,3
To many adds,3
A little bit heavy on the ads but it's ok for the most part.,3
Ad fiasco,3
Game is OKAAAAYY...but the ads are annoying,3
Cool,3
This game is pretty ok but gets boring once you keep playing it offline,3
Nice but too much ads,3
Too much adds,3
Well its a great game but the adds and you can't choose your color u have to press a button and keep pressing it untill you want your color.,3
Ad is the woods in my head around this week and this morning i dont want to argue that the food we have today roast beef with veg for my sponsor big D who helps me through the steps now mate just had a call when you can please mate it's lee Cuxton I need a favour mate I'm going to be able to do it in later brother xx love u to be a pain I've been given free of obsession is key let God do what I need to know how to be a pain I've been given free of obsession is key let God do what I need to know,3
Nice,3
Too many spammy ads and inconsistent gameplay,3
Wow this is the best,3
"Fun Rate 3.4, No Crashing, Small Lags, Minimal Ad Count and Medium Ad Time",3
low,3
👍good game,3
Very simple,3
Too many ads,3
Fun but repetitive asf,3
Pretty good but the ads are just so annoying,3
fun BUT the AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING IS OMG!!,3
Too many ads. I'm use to ads letting you ay for a bit before giving you ads but it's just ads from the start.,3
Way to many ads,3
"It's alright way too many ads tho, only 2 things to do.",3
There are way too much advertisements that ultimately last longer than the game itself.,3
Cool,3
Not terrible,3
Good,3
Too much ads,3
Pretty 👍,3
A fine game but not interesting enough to keep it downloaded for anymore than 20 mins or so.,3
"Pretty good game if you dont count the adds, i usualy play these kinds of games when im traveling or waiting for a bus to kill time so i dont get adds due to me not having internet, but there is one issue and im not sure if its just me or the game, but whenever you get more then 350 charecters it starts to lagg and breaks the gameplay, as i said it could just be my phone, but before downlauding it have that in mind :)",3
"As a concept, this game is quite amusing, but you literally spend more time watching ads than actually playing it.",3
Too much advert,3
This is very faster going game in which we have to increase our players or decrease them that is a very nice,3
Not the best not the worst.,3
I rated it 4 stars only because is a new game and its insanely advertised everywhere an...at least the ads are not fake.What I don't like at this game is that the archers barely reduce the numbers of your troops compared to how many they are in that current wave and the ones in the tower do nothing to your troops so my suggestion about archers...make them is radically smaller numbers but for every archer there is he can kill one of mine and the bosses have really low health :v,3
"The game surely have content, but could be way better. Too many ads you need to turn off your connection to play and also lacks of optimization.",3
Fun at first but stuff plateaus after level 5,3
There are a lot of ads but besides that it is pretty fun but when I got like 300 people it only put me at like 4 point something and I saw that the group of people shrunk when I got over the finish line.,3
It's really fun but after every level you have to watch an add 🤨,3
Varvatosand x,3
"I wish there was more to this game. I'm at level 63 and I have all the characters and all of the places opened for attack, but there isn't another world or anything to keep my attention. If something new isn't added soon, I won't be playing anymore. Plus I have a huge amount of gems but nothing to use them on..",3
🙃😁,3
TOo much ads,3
Too much adds,3
Too many ads. Can barely play the game.,3
Addictive,3
Lag,3
Tooooo much advertising.,3
I wanna play this so much but I don't want ads after every level. It's annoying,3
Good,3
I like it but ist little lonely,3
"I liked playing it. I keep my internet all the time but this game don't like that. It keeps on pushing ads and ads after and after. Then even when I turned off the internet, the condition was same. It's my request to please not to give offline ads.",3
Good time,3
Ok,3
too many ads,3
Game runs well and is good. However I get overloaded with ads to the point its not even worth playing the game.,3
"Ads stink, fun game",3
Not that fun,3
The game is great its your advertising that's making me delete the app every add I get given the opportunity to close the add but everytime it takes me to your marketing sites asking me to download the app that was just on a add I was closing its not right stealing data every time it load when I'm not interested,3
Yah tahas Nahin Hai,3
Kind of dumb,3
"Typical mobile game, i have had a bit of fun but not that much. Has a bit of lag, too.",3
I really wanted to like it. I read the comments about ads and figured I could deal with them... nope. So many ads that it takes away the enjoyment of the game. The game itself was fun... between the ads. I believe I spent more time waiting for the ads than playing the game.,3
"Too many ads, and the obstacles are really tedious",3
Too many ads,3
"I like the game concept, it's different for me.I also don't mind having ads in the games I play, but to have an ad that's about 20-30 secs long after EVERY level I play just gets annoying. So eventhough I like the game, I'm uninstalling because of the way the ads are set up in here.",3
Cool concept.,3
It's pretty fun it lags alot but I guess it's just my phone,3
Too much ads but in overall the game is okay. It's hella boring after some quite of time and too repetetive.,3
Good to know you guys have been together with the world game of games and the last one I have ever had to play with my English teacher and I am not sure how much it would cost me also if it were the world,3
Fun game but it gets boring,3
Just nice for game only time pass,3
"Fun, but very repetitive. So many ads, made me not want to play anymore after 10 min.",3
"Great gameplay, toooo many ads. I spend more time watching ads than actual gameplay.",3
this would be a great game but wow the amount of ads! you can't even begin to enjoy it because the amount of ads,3
"To the people saying too many ads — switch the wifi off 😬❕Unless you can't have it off because you don't want too. My actual review — I love the game, fighting people and making it to the end but it's kinda boring; like after you finish your island, what do you do with your 💎 now? 😐 Please make more islands so atleast the 💎 are still in use. 3 stars. ⭐⭐⭐",3
I would give this game a 5 star but just way way to many ads . Please think about it and get rid of them,3
Ads Ads and more Ads! The Game is fun and I really do like it. But after every single game there is an Ad. Many of these games are made just to watch Ads and this game is one of them. It would be nice if a little music was added on and more sounds also. Please drop some of those long annoying Ads after every single game. I will be unstalling the game and try Not to install games like this one that is only for Ads Ads Ads Ads So annoying 🙄,3
It's bad but it's good if you don't have wifi,3
Its not a bad game and the ads do portray the game correctly I hope for future improvements and better options.,3
😍😍😍😍😍😍,3
Lags alot recently,3
This is a nice game and i love it,3
Is this an ad site or a game. Cant go a round or do anything without something popping up and its boring to have that every single time... has potential,3
ဘိုဘိုဘိုင္,3
😇😗🙂😚😑🙄🙄😶😶😋😍😎😊😎😎😊,3
Why Is It So Laggy,3
a fun game to play when im board,3
TOO MANY COMMERCIALS UGH!!!!!!,3
Just Kinda Average... It Isn't That Engaging and I Deleted it After the 150th Level.,3
It is not that fun but I like it 😏,3
It's a pretty good game it's just it lags to much and I have to reset the game.,3
Its a good game but way too many commercials. You have to watch a commercial everytime you finish a level. Commercials last longer than the levels do.,3
Too much Advertisement,3
"The game itself is good and all, but there is WAY TOO MANY ADS",3
My First attempt was laggy but it got better each round but still its a bit laggy.,3
Rabindra,3
Nadim ıs my Dhadkan.......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,3
Nice,3
"This is a fun game, but after a while it gets pretty boring. Plus the amount of ads you get after finishing a stage, selecting another crate for the rewards to even watching an ad just to change the color, when you have to watch an ad just to change the color of your character, you know you are going overboard with the ads. The skins are kinda cool but their isn't a lot of them making the game kinda short. Overall this is an decent enough game, not the best but not one of the worst either.",3
It's a very good game but sometimes when theres spinning obsticales I dodge them and sometimes some people die at random even though I dodged them,3
"Nice game but not interested we can play 4, 5 times only and you make any interesting right its is good through right 😉",3
The game hangs,3
"Great mechanics, but it's very repetitive with very little variation in the level progression. Waaaay too many ads, but you can play it offline if you want to avoid those — since it's not pay to win. I feel that this game has big potential, if you tone down the ad frequency, add more variation in the levels, create an overarching story, introduce a competitive element and last but not least adding more game mechanics.",3
50-50 for me,3
it gets boring after a while but overall a good game,3
Umar,3
Too many ad,3
Its fun but not can't be installed,3
Jogo muito bom porém os anúncios quebram toda a experiência de jogo.,3
So many ads make it 3 star,3
There is a lot of ads,3
Sometimes it Starts off with so little units that you can't get past first enemies without backing out of the game and coming back in,3
Ads after every level,3
Good game Guys,3
I can't Undownload this app. Why?,3
"Great game to enjoy, but too many damn ads",3
Too much ads,3
Good but too many ads,3
Fun but over the top with the adds,3
اوك,3
Good,3
Eh,3
It's too many ads.,3
It is good 😊 game 👍 what a game not a boring 😉,3
The game is very good but the ads have made it bad.,3
The games is good but contains too much ads it's disgusting 💩,3
Nice game,3
Hjk,3
Not bad,3
Would be 5 but too many commercials,3
ok,3
It's okay okay game but one game is 20 seconds and 30 seconds add this is the only reason 3 star ratting,3
Fun but just a few too many ads. Nice free game.,3
Games ok but as some of the other comments mention it's a bit lagy and can affect your game play 😉,3
Good,3
Good game because adventure game and very fun in game please download now... I am so so happy because i am download this game boring play and past time please download this game now.... .............................. . . . . . . .😊😊,3
It is a fun game but there is an extensive amount of adds. After every level there is an add and levels don't take that long to get through. You can't even put your phone on airplane mode to get rid of them.,3
It was ok,3
Not bad I guess but it still have been deleted by me,3
too many ads,3
"Game is fun, a little easy, yet. Way too many ads. Not relaxing when you have to wait more than play the game.",3
Great game if you're trying to learn basic math. Thr ads are bad if you don't turn off your internet and it's very repetitive. The work the traps were you move your little people so there is not to many where your phone will blow up from to many of them. If your looking for something turn off your brain for little bit this is the game to do that with.,3
Nice 🙂,3
Too many ads right off the bat,3
Less adds would be betterq,3
There are so many ads. After every single level there are ads. We can't even close those ads. It's very annoying.,3
Too many ads.,3
Nicw,3
Very nice game,3
Meh,3
Too many ads,3
Good,3
Good idea but the movement is not smooth its a bit laggy.,3
Its alright the problem is i just got 800 people and the game froze xd...,3
Its fun and good its just that there is alot ads and inappropriate ones so I gave this a 3 star actually 😀😁,3
Great job with a lot more to come to your games,3
It's a cool game.,3
"For the most part when 1st play it- its fun. TONS of ads though. Super easy to play, easy concept also. I wish the levels would get harder as you level up. I wish in the map section it would expand into other countries - after beating the US map. Now I am just playing to play (which is kinda boring). Since I've leveled with everything and have gotten all the skins - I feel like I've beaten the game, which means I'm bored of it now. I completed everything in a matter of a week also.",3
"Too many ads to enjoy the game, a level takes 15 seconds to complete followed by a 30 second ad.",3
Adverts drives me up the wall . But I know you have to have them to make the game free ... It's a ok game ....,3
This is best game for more,3
Its rigged they never want u to win,3
This game is nice but a lot of ads are showing up. Please fix it.,3
"Nice concept, potential time killer but the ad after every level made me uninstall, I understand the need to make money but find a balance.",3
It's ok,3
Fun for a bit but gets old pretty fast. Can avoid ads by playing with phone on flight mode but not ideal in a lot of situations,3
Slightly more fun then the other games I rated but still boring,3
Fun game,3
lag,3
"I have to admit, this IS a fun game, but, if i get to many people in my team the game gets all laggy and i lose practically EVERYONE on my team; which makes it impossible to get to the very top of the staircase thingy at the end. I hope my reveiw was helpful, and that you will fix that glitch. Thanks!",3
Extremely simple. Gets boring because theres no variety,3
Cool game but far to much ads to enjoy the game fully,3
"Pretty good, sometimes it gets a little bit boring cause it's the same thing over and over again.",3
Kind of intresting,3
This game is cool and everything but it's kinda laggy....idk if its because I have android or what but its laggy when you get a high number of those people things lol I dont know how to say them but yea....AND I CANT EVER MAKE IT TO THE TOP it's really weird but I'm gonna say its entertaining I guess.,3
I injoys it .it gives me much thrill and exitoment,3
👌,3
Fun game. Three stars because of the popups,3
This is a fun game but there is so many ads. There is an ad after every level. You have to watch an ad to get the skins that your earn. Fun game but to many ads in my opinion,3
Takes to long to download,3
This is random game,3
Good don't like ads though Prob 3 🌟,3
"The game is quite fun when you are allowed to play it. It is fairly generous with the in game currency (at the early levels at least), and it always feels winnable if you make the right choices. The town building mechanic in between games is confusing and inadequately explained; it's very unclear what's going on. The biggest problem is the ads. There are far too many of them (at least one between every game) and no way to remove them. It's a deal breaker for me - uninstalled.",3
I hate so bad so much adds even sec a ad come,3
Good but too many adverts,3
Very good,3
Too many adds,3
"It's a fun game, but it's too bad the ads have more running time than the game. You play for about 30 seconds, and the ads run for anywhere between 30 seconds and a minute...and it happens between EACH level. Would keep it if the ads weren't so long and as many, but I'm not.",3
The game is okay but like everyone says the ads are outrageous. I have so many diamonds what do you use them for? Once you fill the map the game is just boring. Developers didn't think this through.,3
So many adds and not much if a callenge,3
The ads after every level are driving me crazy.,3
No reason for an ad after every level,3
Way too many ads,3
"Maybe if it is not too lag, it'll be more fun playing.",3
Not the best bet helps u with math,3
🤐👍👍👍👍 super,3
was great but boring i am really serious i am sorry 😅,3
Think thank hai but leg karta hai,3
Its ok kind of game..after sometimes its boring,3
"If the levels were about 3x longer at least the game would be fun but it's only a short distraction, which is a shame as it looks great",3
Good,3
It's an OK game,3
This game is addicting but daaaaaaaang way to many ads,3
Φένεται ωρέο αλλά θα το δω στην πορεία...,3
Its so fun to play but it is so slow,3
Owais,3
I love this game 🎮🎮🎮,3
to much ads but good,3
Good,3
"Cool game, but too many ads",3
i like the game pls make new stickmans,3
"A fun concept but there's little development. The levels never get any harder, the number of guys onscreen is always around 100, and the maths is always incredibly simple. I wish the devs would improve the gameplay. Also the weird gems side quest thing detracts from it.",3
This game is very addictive and a time killer. But not only is there too many ads but when you get a lot of people my game starts freezing like hell and I end up losing like 5/8 of my team hopefully you guys fix this in future updates.,3
ADS!!!!! TO disable-turn off your WiFi,3
"As a math teacher, I love this game; however, there is an ad between everything.. so ya. 3",3
Very good app,3
Fun time waster. Too many ads,3
this is so coll but 3 star kasi is boring,3
It's nice not so much ads I give it a 9/10,3
Before launching the game disable network access (android 10+) to stop ads altogether. Entertaining for about 10 minutes then it gets too easy and repetitive.,3
Its fine.,3
This game always says unfortunetely something has gone wrong its so annoying and most of the time it jams,3
"I think I beat the game. Got all the skins, all the island is built. Kind of sucks.",3
"Fun to play and a great time-waster. Also, it's not pay-to-win. However, it lacks depth and could be more interesting if it had things like quests and leaderboards. Could increase my likelihood of playing long-term. It also has a bit too much ads for my taste but its quite reasonable compared to other games. Full Review on my YT on jb_Games: Count Masters (Review)",3
Hello every one this game is amazing not bad...really excelent... Tray naw,3
bikash,3
meh to many ads,3
good😍😍,3
Meh,3
Ankit gamer,3
"Graphics are good, concept is nice and fun. But, you can't get a good flow of game play as the ads are relentless. If I'm having to agree to T&C's for a game, then allow me to play the game smoothly rather than bombard me with ads! So, as ok as this game is, I'm uninstalling after less than 20mins.",3
Generally fun but waaaay too many adverts which means i will uninstall.,3
To early to tell,3
Too much advertisements.,3
Anna's bin malik,3
I like it to but the Constance ads,3
Fun but spent more time watching adverts,3
"This game is awsome ! It would be 5 stars defo if just one thing was fixed ......... I ended up with two people \ characters and i came to a group of around 40, usally this would mean i lost as they had more than me, but i some how defeated them and got passed !😬 I dont know how this happened but it must be a glitch . Also when ads are not needed it plays them all the time but when i need a ad for extra dimonds there isnt one which is ok some times but not others . They are why 3 stars Pls fix",3
"10 seconds of gameplay, 30+ seconds of ads. Repeat. The game is actually ok and polished otherwise.",3
good but i hate the ads and lag,3
To many ads :(. It is not for me. Sorry.,3
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩,3
It is a fun game because it makes you think fast but an ad after EVERY level (which takes 30 seconds to complete). The ads are around a minute long and not worth the wait for it. I would keep the app if it were after every few levels,3
I'm blue and blue as my favourite colour😀,3
Too short play for length of ads,3
"Ads are terrible, and makes you want to download it. Great game though",3
To much lag its like you didn't test the game before launch,3
Maynak Dipak Pastil,3
I kind of like it but I don't really know what I don't like about it,3
Nice,3
The game is nice to play,3
Bad controls,3
I love this game but there are sooo many ads,3
The game is simple and fun but the constant ads after every single level are unnecessary,3
Good game just far to many adds,3
"Brainless game, minimal strategy and lots of ads.",3
Glitchy.. game glitches and freezes when I get over 200 people. It happens every time. It's fun but I wish they would fix this and if they did I will fix this review as the game is fun,3
"Close WiFi and play the game, after some playtimes uninstall it😹",3
"Additive game play, good graphics. Massive downside is the constant ads! Completely ruins it. Also what is the little village about, hot thousands of diamonds now but nothing to spend them on.",3
Too many ads.,3
Too many ads,3
Not my knd of game😐,3
DELETE - Just ok. Not enough variety so it gets boring fast,3
To many ads but a ok game,3
Um its cool i guess,3
Repetitive quick,3
Fun but SO MANY ADS it's unbearable,3
"No challenge whatsoever, super easy. Impossible to get past certain obstacles. Another cool idea with poor execution",3
It sucks,3
This game is nice butttt ads omg !,3
"This game is so fun! Its fun to collect your people but when you get too much players, it sort of laggs a little. And also this game has so much adds which disracts me from playing this enjoyable game.",3
"It's a time passer, but not one you would continue to play over n over n over again. I had this on my phone for approximately 12 minutes, then deleted it. It got mundane and predictable after a while. It's fine if you want to kill 10 minutes. However the Ads in the game are annoying. Each game you have to watch a 30 sec video prior to the game starting...",3
Great game to pass the time. P.s make sure your data/wifi isn't on so no ads show,3
A simple game but not entertaining. It keeps repeating,3
Ok,3
Bole la,3
"So it's a cool game, but VERY glitchy. It freezes so I can't move my guys and then it unfreezes and I only have like 20/150 dudes left to beat a boss that takes 120 men.",3
៍យហេ,3
It's a good game. Jus it doesn't get harder. After U get to a certain level it jus palys the same ones over and over. Also at the end of the game I I can't get past x6.2. like I had 360 men after I went thru all the opsticals but then if got rid of like half of them so I couldn't get past x6.2 I think I need to update those things but other then that it's fun game,3
"This game is pretty decent, though there are too many ads. I know I can turn off my internet, but sometimes I forget when I try to watch yt, and there is a small chance of getting to the end of the part where you make a stack. So I wouldn't recommend this if you are impatient since there are unskippable ads.",3
Too many ads,3
My mum said that I need to start pooing on the toilet and not in the bath,3
Too many ads,3
Good,3
Small place,3
"I like the game, there's just far too many adverts",3
Qq,3
"Average. Every level is exactly the same difficulty eg dead easy, as the one before. Gave up at level 75. There is no progression at all.",3
"I like it,, also I like the way it doesn't have much adssss!",3
All i got to say is adverts lol,3
Ads ads ads ads ads and focken ads,3
"Its good but a lot of ads , when i got 200 or more the game would get stuck and come out of the app , but game itself is good",3
"The concept is cool. You run through and try to collect as many little dudes to win. You can earn new skins, and as well you can slowly build up a mini city and take over regions on a map. Eventually the levels stagnate though. 90% of the game play is just watching ads, you literally can't do anything with out there being an ad. If it weren't for the ads I would be more invested but they are too much.",3
It's an offline game that you really could use to just you know spend your time playing I think it deserves a three,3
"It's alright but there's an ad after every level. Gameplay is simple and too easy, don't know if it gets harder because I couldn't stand watching a long ad every 15 seconds (that's how long it takes to finish a level).",3
Too many ads but fun,3
It's a fun game but to many advertisements,3
Like the game. Way to many ads,3
So much ads,3
Too many ads.. at least let a couple levels go by before jamming an ad through,3
I love it. But there too many ads.,3
"Fun game, but half your time is literally spent watching ads",3
Cheatingest game,3
nice,3
Hate that most of the ads after completing a board you can't skip once it's half way through,3
You run out of things to do in a couple of days.,3
Great game but glitches a lot on my phone with or without WiFi on not sure why? but it's annoying.,3
"Fun, to many ad's.",3
overall a somewhat fun game but pretty basic and little skill to play it.,3
"The game is fun, but so many ads. There's an ad every 60 seconds of play, at least.",3
YG,3
I like this game,3
One of the fun ways to kill time.,3
I like this it keeps motivated and calm,3
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwww,3
This is not bad or not good it is for our mind resting,3
"Nice game but once I have too many players, the game started to move extra slow and also freezing my phone. Needs to be fixed!!",3
The levels seem the same,3
Reàlly good but when I get 200 it gets really damn laggy,3
Sick of ads,3
"Run of the mill, repetitive...",3
"This is such a fun and exciting game. However the sheer amount of ads was enough to make me write a review & delete it after 20 minutes. :) Please, please give people the option to opt out of ads for a small fee or atleast reduce the amount to every 3 or 4 levels. Plus make the levels/rounds last longer. I spend more time watching ads and the little men climb stairs than I do actually playing. Thanks",3
"Ad's are oversized onscreen, literally having to exit the game after every level, five stars otherwise. Love the game though great time killer.",3
The ad get stuck...its ok,3
I gave it three star's because it glitches and when it glitches you DIE! You have to Play against red And keep expanding so you can fight against red and not DIE! so it's not the best game but yeah I still think that it is a good game but I'm just trying to say it's not the best game. And another one of my problems Is that there is adds ALWAYS! coming out of nowhere even when you die and you don't want to revive there's an add after that anyway and all you want to do is play the Game. Bye,3
Why can't I beat the brakes off the boss characters? I should be able to stomp him when my Lil men have him down.,3
Too many ads not enough change in game okay,3
This game is too too easy so I give it a 3 star raiting,3
Most boring game ever. It seemed like a OK idea but it is the same extremely easy game over and over with so so many ads.,3
We enjoy lot this is a wonderful game,3
"Yes, the game is fun and easy to play, and the levels are so short and simple, but the advertisements are just the biggest disruption and annoyance whilst playing. I was playing earlier, getting my score and before the round concludes, an advertisement. Please lower the amount and more people will play and you'll receive better reviews.",3
I would have given this game a five star but I was just playing level 29 and my game completely stopped. I also experienced lag in every other level. I see some people saying if you do not play with Internet you will not get adds but when I tried that my game crashed. I do like the idea of the game. There is parts of the game that I love and parts that I hate so could you please take away some of the ads and try to find a way to stop the lag so I can play offline thanks.,3
It's fun just not as interesting as most wood thing,3
"Love the game but I'm I done? Already conquered the U.S. and built my whole tiny island and now, no progression.... Any other countries to conquer or a bigger homeland???",3
Nice,3
What's the point of diamonds? I have so many for no reason. Also the repetitive game play gets old fast. Change up the levels make it actually have difficulty and let us get more than 200 or so stick men at a time,3
"Too many ads, and the content gets boring after you fully upgrade the side game island",3
Yso,3
I like this game love it but seriously if your gonna make amusements to the game then please take away the adds I mean like there are so many.,3
"Enjoyable game but soooooooo many ads! Like, you legit spend 3X the amount of time watching the same stupid ads rather then playing the actual game & it's annoying as hell.",3
"Like it, too many ads tho",3
"I have only played this game for 1 minute and passed 5 levels already. This is way to easy. Also super laggy. i have a touch sceen computer i can fold in to a kind of tablet and it laggs so much i might crash. but if you want a fun mobile game try a color by number game. And please fix the adds too. I know you need money but its kind of overwhelming.please try if you want a add full laggy game that is super easy. and if you play this game called queen bee, dont do anything in it that you see.",3
It's decent. I guess. I dunno. Part of it is rigged. Don't download.,3
I guess it's kind of cool it's just gets boring sometimes,3
The only reason why I'm not giving this game 5 stars is because if you get too many men the hff ame will freeze.,3
I. I am gg fro m gtf yvyf,3
Good but too many ad,3
Goood game but Very very slowly to run and play,3
It was a bit boring but over all s pretty good game,3
An amazing app that is the best,3
Its stupid,3
"The game isn't all that great, and it's definitely not overly strategic. It's basic math with a rushed timer. There are loads of ads and not many great things to say.",3
This game is good but the ads are disgusting🤢🤮,3
It's extremely glitchy at times and uses up your data but apart from that this game is fun.,3
Good game 🎮,3
To much ads,3
To much advertising,3
Viele Werbung 😏,3
"Like the concept and it was fun tell it lagged really bad, which caused some of the guys to die due to it.",3
It's okay but not the best I feel like it be better,3
It was a bit glitchy,3
The game sometimes dosent allow you to win.,3
"This game is fun, but there are way too many ads. It really takes away from the game if you have to watch an ad after every level.",3
Too many ads,3
"Very laggy, If I do play it, it comes out not working very well which has made 4 losses, it's decent if it's not laggy which happens very rarely though",3
Fun! To many ads though,3
Adverts all the time,3
"Fun premise, but the individual runs are too short and the ads are too long . . . For every 30 seconds or so of gameplay there's a 30 second add, or sometimes two. Longer runs with more decision trees would make it more worth playing given how much time the ads take.",3
It is a good game other than one thing. The adds. They are so time consuming and take up most of the game. But still a really good game.,3
So many bugs.,3
Lotta ads.,3
Boring,3
y. 🎫🎫. 🧨🎐 🎏⚾ 🎏🎏🎏🎏 🎉⚾.,3
"To many ads, laggy.",3
Many ads,3
Way too many ads,3
To many ads,3
"Pros: nice, mindless game to pass the time Cons: had to watch ads after EVERY single game...& each game only lasts mere seconds Any game that plays ads after every single game (instead of every few games), especially when they're that short of games, doesn't really make it worth it. Would rate higher if they at least put 4-5 games before an ad.",3
It not bad,3
Its ok,3
It's so glichey,3
Very nice game and I clip on the charge on your mobile my mobile,3
Turn your wifi off and the game is ok,3
Fun game ads galore,3
l really like this game,3
Not that good,3
Could be more stars. It's very addictive but an ad after EVERY friggin level? WTH are the greedy publishers thinking? SMH,3
Too many ads,3
This app's okay.,3
Good,3

"This is app is good,but the only problem is1. whene I get to 200 minions it's lagging And 2.there's ad every single time I win a level,can you pls fix it thanks 👍",3
Got boring quickly,3
Nice,3
I Think This Game Is Cool 😁❤❤,3
Too many ads,3
This game is fun just to many ads,3
TOO MANY ADS! ONE AFTER every level. This will be the reason.,3
Sooooo many advertising,3
Good 😃😃😃😃😃😃😄😄😄😄😄😄😚,3
Sarmıyor.,3
Simple game,3
Nice🤗🤗🤗🤗,3
I like the game,3
Needs serious tweeking graphics looks good and the challenges needs some serious over haul. For one why have them do a pyramid at the end why not just go tell them what they won and move on to the next stage i just find that s big waste of time and makes redundant,3
I've played the game and it was fun but I gave it a 3 because of laggy and to many adds,3
"So good but sooooo many ads. I just back out & then open to where i was though, so yea lol still playing. Funny i got it because of an add.",3
Well this game is kind a awesome but it's kinda hard because when some red people it low my people my lowest people hope make it easier.,3
Too many ads,3
It is cool but too many ad but it is a really cool game,3
3/5 Gtns bey ni de votre e7h2f h7fs de dai Count Masters.,3
I was very disappointed when I found out that you can't go over 6.2x,3
As far as Competitive games are concerned its one I'd put as mediocre to fun,3
Good time killer,3
To be honest i still did not play the game but it is very boring because by looking at the add try to make the add more fun plsss cone on guys and also it is fun,3
Bro. This is decent bt Wayyyyyyyy to boring,3
😊😀😁😂😃😄😅😆😇😈😉😯😐😑😕😠😬😡😢😴😮😮😤😥😦😧😨😩😰😟😱😳😳😵😶😜😝😋😋😗😙,3
This game is so easy to play it is when you gather so many people and fight.,3
"Fun game, but jeez man, you can't do two things in a row without there being an ad. Ad here, ad there, everywhere an ad ad. I get they help make games like this free, but it's a bit much.",3
"Yeah there are ads after each level, but I don't mind when it's such a casual game. Room to improve, but I'm impressed with what they do have.",3
I like it and would rate it 5 stars but all the commercials after EVERY round is pretty annoying. I only play a couple rounds before the commercials are just too much.,3
😊,3
উজন,3
Fun Game!! WAYYY TOO MANY ADS.,3
"same as other people said there are a lot of ads, but I downloaded this a couple days ago and already have nothing to spend diamonds on anymore... am I missing another island or something? also have unlocked every skin and colour and I haven't been non stop playing I have a job 😂",3
Good game ruined by a stupid amount of ads.,3
It is fun but when I click on watching an ad to do something it doesn't do it.,3
Fun game but way toooo many ads. There needs to be a balance and it's not after each level. Maybe one every 3 to 4 minutes.,3
Ok guys dont worry about the ads turn off ur internet bcz ads use ur internet so just turn it off and dont claim the skins probably useless anyway so problem fixed no more ads enjoy シ︎,3
Aditya,3
It is really nice because it is fun ok,3
U should include an action run where u play until i die n have a leaderboard for the longest run,3
It is very expetiv,3
How to buy the game? I don't want to see all these advertisements.,3
Great game but to many adds it's impossible to play with soooooooooooo many adds but fun to play but enough with the adds already 😡😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿,3
Its just to pass time but not that good game,3
"I changed it to 3, because you made me watch a 15 sec commercial,without being able to back out of it,for me that's a no,no, uninstalling.",3
Can't collect gems after a victory. Circle on button just spins and spins. It does that constantly after wins. Can't even watch an ad if I wanted to. Never seen a game I can't watch an ad on.,3
Super duper easy.,3
Ok,3
Nice game bur too many ads.,3
Good,3
Best game but ads are not good pls see that,3
Great racing. Cars are realistic. Best customization options I've ever seen.,3
its oki,3
"Good, could be better. There is a premise for a good fun game but the adds get in the way.",3
Maybe too many adds,3
To many ads but its fine i guess,3
Lags alot,3
Too many ads. They spoil all the fun the game offers. Having to skip advertising every 15 seconds really bothers me,3
to many ads ik you do it for many but every time I finish one level Straight away another ad comes up it's very annoying But other then that it's ok,3
I don't know why but on my phone this game keeps on glitching (even on my cousin's phone)even if I have network 😢😢can u please fix it,3
"Perfectly harmless game with a pernicious data harvesting aspect. Interesting that ads run offline, meaning they must be pre installed.",3
Only way to lower ads is to quit playing thier games until they change.,3
Was fun at but then after maybe 2 or 3 plays its an ad....then if u when a prize u have to watch a ad 4 that prize than it forces u 2 watch 2 more ads 2 get the prizes there's no option 2 bypass this. Spent more time watching ads the playing the game.,3
dumb,3
"BRING ON THE BATTLE! Oh wait, adds...",3
Soo Nice game•.•,3
I only gave it 3 stars 🌟🌟🌟 because there is ads everytime after you play a level. But everything else is on point to be honest.,3
The game has potential but far too many ads. One 30 second add after every 15 second level! Ridiculous!,3
"Its a good game its just not fun. I was so bored and i saw it, dowloaded it..and i was playing it and i got even more bored",3
It's a grate game to play,3
Nice,3
Theres a game in your ads,3
"This app is great and all but the 2 problems i'm having are the ads and the lag. Your showing too many ads and you need to show less ads for an example, let's just say you want a reward then they ask you ""Watch a video for a free skin?"" And it's either yes or no. Can you show less ads that way? The second problem is the lag. Literally when i'm at the end for the boss battle and theres too many people, it lags and idk why but you developers need to pull yourself together and fix it!",3
"The main idea is very cool and fun, but the secondary ideas are like characters and the mapIt. was too short, I mean it ended fast If you make more characters or more countries on a map, it will be better",3
There's lots bug in game,3
It was fun,3
"IDK if it's bad that a privacy policy is needed, or good that they're warning you about it, but I did not agree to it, nor did I play the game.",3
I like it but every round ther is a add and every time i unlock a new skin i need to watch an add to claim it SO ANOYYING,3
Fun but too many ads,3
"Starts off fun, but seriously boring, after 50 levels, i just got bored & stopped playing. Too easy.",3
"It has way to many ads and the ""rounds"" are way to short other than that it is a decent game.",3
"Cute game but I have never seen so many ads in my life. It's understood that the company must make money, but 6 ads in less than 5 minutes is ridiculous. Uninstalled.",3
Not bad but also not good medium .,3
NOT GOOD GOOD,3
Omo this game is good but ads too much,3
Too invasive advertising,3
Works well but mostly no sound plus more time on ads that is not in real game plz delete them k?,3
To many ads,3
I love this game. I'm never bored when playing it. I just gave it 3 stars because of the amount of ads I see in one game. I just can't breathe because of them. But thank you count masters! This game is really cool!👍🏾,3
So many adds,3
Game is super fun and entertaining but the commercials are way to long and on every level. This is only worth playing if your willing to pay for no ads. I'm not...,3
Game not as challenging as I hoped,3
It was so nice but that advert was annoying,3
It is getting boring at some Point.,3
Not bad good but what botred,3
"There is no end to have, I've completed the island but still it continues to earn diamonds, what's the point continuing further. Please send the game",3
I love this gam,3
Not a bad game way to many adverts and keeps going funny,3
Limited. Would be better if you could achieve higher then 6.2× also fight different countries not just America as always 👀,3
"There are A LOT of ads. I don't understand why developers don't switch to banner ads. They're less intrusive and so less likely to have so many people uninstall. If you switch to airplane mode, it will get rid of the ads. This does mean you can't collect skins, or build your city very well. You need to watch ads to be able to do both those things. If you just wanna play the running game and not worry about collecting and building, then you'll be perfectly happy in airplane mode!",3
"Fun concept. SO many ads. It got too annoying, uninstalled it.",3
Fun but too many ads. Waaaaay too many ads,3
Ok game,3
it is so fun,3
I love this game but it have whyyyyyy to many adds that's why I gave it 3 stars,3
"Amazing game , but the ads are horrible",3
"The premise is solid and mind-numbingly satisfying, but there's a 30-second ad after EVERY level. I just can't.",3
A(,3
"Game is fun but the ads are ridiculous, I would even pay a dollar or so not to have ads on here, it's craziness.",3
Muito anúncio !!!!,3
❤,3
Its a fun concept but the lag makes it nearly unplayable,3
Good game,3
Boleh lahhh drpd x ada,3
Barely started playing but seems fun!,3
I'm ok with the ads but it is sooo slow,3
Fun game,3
More ads then play uninstalled,3
Satisfying,3
"Good game but too much ads, o recommend to play it offline as it has less or no ads at all.",3

يسعد ربكو,3
"I really like the concept of the game, but the ads have become overwhelming. Also, only 9 skins is a little disappointing.",3
This game would be so much more enjoyable if you didn't spend as much time playing the game as you do watching the adverts,3
"Can't get to the top. Even the first level cant get the top level. Its impossible to get the top level. Otherwise, it's a fun pastime.",3
it's cool,3
Not that realy good,3
Nice 🙂,3
"not fun at all. just go offline to avoid ads, but will lost a skin(need to watch ads to get the skin after filled bar) or keep playing to get enough coin to buy skin instead. Note: if go offline and online once ads will appear and go offline again ads will NOT dissappear, just need to go offline and restart the apps.",3
It's not very good but it's oh OK 😅,3
THES CAM IS NELS,3
3 stars because 1. It has way to much ads when you complete a level a ad plays 2. Its not thats challenging like dont make it way to much challenging but make medium 3. There's nothing to do after you completed the first level like can you please set it up so there's a free mode where you can build your level,3
Everything add,3
6s,3
It's all right but the adds are annoying😐,3
Super,3
Not much to do on it. You unlock 9 skins. That's it,3

I love the game but there are way too many adds.,3
Not bad.,3
Too many ads,3
A full ad break follows every level. Frequently the ads are longer than the actual level. Really bad balance for an otherwise OK game,3
خیلی عالیه مرسی از سازنده,3
"Levels are so short, you spend more time watching adds than playing. It's fun, and I'd pay for an add free game.",3
Cool,3
Not bad,3
"It gives you a fake amount of people, I went through a 2x one and got 27 ( not an even number ) I went through a 3x one and got 26, please learn your time tables.",3
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌Ok,3
Game is good,3
"Its a bit boring ,but still fun",3
"This game is ok-ok, everyone can try it. But after sometime I found it boring so...",3
Way to many ads (one after every level attempt minimum) and the actual game gets old quickly. Super easy to win every level.,3
Good math game becuse its adding and mutaplaying. To many ads. And when you want to change colers you only get 3 spins then...ad only reasone i gave it 3 stars is because we can learn from it,3
Fun game but the ads ruin it. I get that's how they make money but it's overloaded.,3
It's quiet good but why forcing ads,3
Wow,3
Could be fun so many adds its almost unplayable,3
خزابزر,3
Om,3
It's fun playing this game 🎮,3
Too many commercials,3
I Don't Think These a Game 🎮 Like an Awesome 👍😎,3
"Still trying, maybe later I'll give a better rating",3
La verdad me gusta este juego pero ay demasiado anuncios y eso molesta el juego esta padre y es muy emocionante al jugar pero lo que fastidia son los anuncios así que por eso solo le doy tres estrellas,3
"The game is really fun, and the ad timing is decent, so I find myself resorting to this as a good way to pass time.",3
So many adds,3
It was alright but ads after EVERY level was too much,3
"There's not a lot to do, same thing, should add more.",3
I like this game.,3
the game is good turn intenet of for no ads but the amount of time to download on google play store is ridiculas so i think delete it,3
It has a very bad connection glitches a lot but it is a lot of fun,3
Nice,3
Nice Ad viewer. There's also that what otherwise could be an interesting game between Ads.,3
I hate this game-,3
"Honestly a lot of fun but the advertisements finally became too much, spent more time on ads compared to playing",3
Nice,3
"The concept is decent but the execution is painfully repetitive, and you quickly teach a point where you have no more goals. I just downloaded this game yesterday and I've already effectively finished the game, between levels, earned skins, and castle attacks. Also, y'know, still wish you only got ads if you asked for them through things you want to earn, like extra gems or whatever. Also, the blatant Fall Guys and Among Us references in the skins had me rolling my eyes.",3
"This was really fun for the first two hours or so. After that I unlocked all the skins and attacked all of the lands... Yet I'm still earning coins to expand the land, that never gives me the option to do again. Not really worth it.",3
Too easy. No challenge,3
One ad after every single play is annoying. Maybe try to do an ad every 3 or 5 plays.,3
Very repetive. Adverts need to close at end especially if they are presented in the wrong resolution and you don't have access to the close. Gone.,3
"Game is nice, but full of ads...",3
Mucho comercial,3
Best,3
"Ok, little bit laggy but good time passer",3

Good,3
It was fun for about 5 minutes. But the rounds are too shorts and the ads are ridiculous.,3
Good game but too much ads,3
This is a good game but it keeps on lagging. They're also too many ads.,3
Nice game,3
"You can actually get through a level without an add, very rare!",3
Fun game but spend more time watching ads then playing......,3
"This game ""USED"" to be one of my favorite games. The reason I gave this game three stars was that 1. You'll get bored after you get all the characters 2. Was that it was not one bit of fair enough for example the thing it did was that the game just gave me 10+ and I had get it but I would still lose even if I all the time got the most I even looked at if they are plus or times and quickly counted in my head and had too much ads but because I liked it I didn't count the ads. It's fun though.!!!!!",3
Good,3
Fun,3
But Zoom meeting with,3
Nice game,3
Great game but far too many ads I cannot cope! I play for 15seconds and get 30seconds of ad. I feel like I'm earning this app lists of money! Uninstalled sorry.,3
It's fun game mode,3
When I bought the starter pack it didn't give me the diamond extracter,3
Thanks Google and the other side of the most important thing is that the information contained in this email,3
Ads after every level,3
👍🏻,3
to much adds but it is ok,3
Its ok,3
Not the best game I ever played it's just repeats everything all over again and when you have a big crowd of people like 150 and theres 5 or 20 and you want to get 20 but you get five fix this by making the platform bigger,3
The game freezes too much and glitches too much very hard to control,3
It's not the best because it is a very laggy game even with the Wifi off. :/,3
This game would be really fun but there are just way too many ads.,3
"This game is so addictive and can waste the day away or even through the night without sleep. I would give it little higher rate except for the ads after each level. If not for the ads, it would be a 5 stars.",3
not bad,3
Would have got more than 3 stars if there wasn't so many ads,3
Love the game but too often I get ads like every level I can not understand why People play the game please stop the ads from interfering with the game,3
Love the game. It's very fun. I just can't live with you have to watch a commercial after every level.,3
Too much ads but very nice,3
Haven't downloaded it yet but I could tell it's a good game,3
Ridiculous number of ads.,3
Too many ads,3
You will spend longer watching advertisements than being able to play the game.,3
"Game is ok. An ad after every level is just too much. I have more time with ads than the game. I get free games need ads, but this is too much",3
Reading others reply i fell lets see i have just downloaded it,3

"ads after basically every level, but it's okay for passing time",3
It is different.,3
This game is fun and silly,3
मय,3
It's definitely fun!!!!!!!! Too many adds and just a tad bit of lagging!,3
Good,3
"Just too many inter-level ads, otherwise, it's pretty fun.",3
"I have seen in other comments that it has a TON of ads, but i tried it and it was not that bad, however, game is VERY laggy. This game could have a big piece of potential. Also, runs are too short. If developers improve these issues, this game would be AWESOME! (Also sorry for bad english)",3
I like the game a lot and its worth getting,3
OK not challenging enough for me too basic but tried cause I kept seeing it hoping for more exciting boards or just more in general .. Still grateful for the opportunity to have had played it .,3
Game is awesome to play. So many ads pop up everytime I try to play the game. Its so annoying!!!,3
Good app but too much adds,3
The game itself I find fun but there are too many ads so I uninstalled it.,3
"The game is mostly a vehicle for ads, but whatever. My major complaint with the gameplay is that there's no real sense of progress, the levels never get any longer or harder, so it quickly becomes boring.",3
What a game,3
"Quite a satisfying game, just too much ads",3
"I was loving it but it half froze. By half froze I mean, the figuers stopped going forward. The feet were still moving, the animation in back ground still moving! I exit and return and its still doing the same thing. Ill try delete and reinstall..........",3
Too much ads,3
Good,3
Good for maybe first 20 levels after that it's just a repeat really,3
Really glitchy and too many ads.,3
It gets boring,3
It's not that fun 🙄😤😞🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,3
I would give it 3 stars because if you completed your island there is nothing to do with the diamonds anymore :(( and Very boring when you play it alot for sometime..,3
Good,3
Too much ads but fun,3
"Cool game, but WAY too many ads!",3
"This game is fun, but when I Multiply into larger number it gets SUPER glitchy and it makes it less enjoyable",3
You just play over and over agian and it is fun,3
Nise games,3
Its not a bad app but it isint a good app ither its got some glicht isues but other wise its ok,3
"Easy way to get rid of ads, just turn off your data. Don't get why so many people complain when there's an easy way to get around it, and it's free.",3
Alright,3
OK,3
Cool game not that addictive,3
In all honesty I downloaded this app because of the idiot who played it in the ad But it is a good game I would recommend it if you are on a road trip or something (Without wifi because of the stupid ads),3
So boring...,3
Too many ads.,3
Super,3

Has lots of ads and is very boring Dont get this game. Sub to eystreem,3
"Too many, too Long ads",3
If you have high gb ram and storage phone you can play easily. Simple!,3
"Turned on airplane mode and it turns out that the game is tiny and you can complete it in about 2 hours. Sort of fun, but I'm just amazed at how small it is. What's the point of the island? Anyway, it's sort of ok.",3
"Decently fun. Except 15 seconds of game before you finish a level. Then a thirty second ad. Then another level. Then another ad. Oh, and it doesn't always recover the player interface on the way back from the ad.",3
WOW HAHAHA 😝😝😝,3
"THE ADS SUCK!!! Great game, but, UGGGHHH",3
Ehhh,3
Sup,3
Not a bad game. Just gets boring after a while. Put it in airplane mode and no ads.,3
"Ads after each level, and ads are longer than the level. Otherwise fun",3
Maduka Lamichhane,3
Your game is really addictive im so addicted omg but i would recommend that we be able to go back to other stages and get all sorts of different stuff and challenges but anyways its fun : ) also your ads are bull**** why create such a nice games and add ads why there are some hungry people oit there yes but yall are too shameless the ads are so alot i even want to kill those small people myself plz AVOID ADS : l,3
"It's fun to pass some time, horrible level progression feels like doing the same old same old over and over, of course lots of ads",3
this game so good but i think he is great game its count 123 he verry goodnes i like this game👍❤,3
"After playing for a minute, it got boring.",3
It's fun but too much ads. To avoid ads I would close app and re-open app again to avoid watching ads.,3
To many ads,3
good,3
Good,3
Too many ads! Game is neat.,3
Nice game,3
Just an annoying ads,3
Interesting but far too many ads,3
Entertaining for a short amount of time as it has overwhelming ads but besides that it's a decent game.,3
Gets boring after a while plz make this more interesting,3
If you are frustrated with ads turn off mobile data and then play,3
"Haven't had any issues with the game. Not much fun, I find it very repetitive. Good for quick mental automatics I guess but if you're good at that, is a piece of cake. Island element is nice, but it's barely explained, as are upgrades at the bottom of the screen (find out I can have more than 1 person at the start at level 18). Ads are AWFUL, I spend more time by watching ads rather than playing. At least do an ad every two levels or something. Overall not bad, but not great.",3
Its okay,3
I just wished there weren't that many ads,3
Yamete,3
Too many adverts. I get that you need to put them in but not after every game....... like the game but have stopped playing due to this,3
It's quite fun but then gets boring because u get an insane amount of ads. But if u want to play a insanely repetitive game with loads of ads go ahead no one's stoping u,3
It's fine but no sound like the ads. There is no skill Involved just lots of ads,3
Sooooo many ads. Each level takes 5 sec to complete and then followed by 30 sec of ads.,3
"Nice game,, time killer, but there is a problem, when i play with internet connection, adds comings and game doings hang, mobile hang,",3
Good,3
ممتاز,3
good,3
"This game would be so much better if there was some strategy involved. You can't group your army tighter, you can't pause and wait for moving obstacles.",3
😉🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘,3
🅢︎🅐︎🅝︎🅐︎ 🅜︎🅐︎ 🅔︎🅝︎🅢︎🅣︎🅞︎🅛︎ 🅟︎🅘︎🅛︎🅔︎🅢︎🅢︎🅢︎🅙︎😭😭😭😭😭,3
This game is a good time pass play... But I'm giving it a 3star rating coz if the count exceeds the game just stucks nd hangs... This is amajor I face with..,3
"Enjoy, but too many ads. Fix it. I hope it doesn't have any ads after this",3
"It veers off the end many times when. Avoiding dangers, it gets annoying losing All your people before the end. And how do we tell what's a better body or suit ?",3
Who else came here from tik tok? And it's pretty good,3
To many commercials makes the game un enjoyable,3
Ads between every game and the levels do not get harder.,3
I hate it and love it so I gave it three stars,3
It's ok,3
There are so many add 😢but still good,3
Great if you are too bored. Was fun for the first 10 minutes but got very repetitive and the ads made it worse by being too much as it takes over 70% of the time you spend on the app leaving jus about 30% or less for the actual game.,3
Price good,3
It was good game but when u got too big it started to lag,3
I give it 3 stars bc when im playing THE game IT GIVES ME AN AD PLS CHANGE IT,3
It's a good game it just keeps on freezing when you have over 200 people in your group 💗,3
I gues but,3
Di,3
"Simple and fun enough game, but ads are out of control.",3
their is a LOT of adds and that is really annoying,3
I wouldn't say it's bad I also wouldn't say its good The truth is... It needs a HUGE update. I hope it improves,3
This is a good game it just has to many ads,3
Yeah I think this game is good but the ads,3
The game is too easy and has too many ads.,3
This game was awesome until my game got much laggy when I get alot of people the jump kill alot of them im very 😡 😡 angry,3
"Esta bien, pero a veces hay fallos que hacen que pierdas muñequitos. Y se puede jugar sin WiFi 😁",3
Not great,3
The reason I gave 3 stars is because it keeps lagging and there are lots of ads,3
Obsurd number of ads,3
its fun but after a whlie it gets borning,3
Fun game but you end up spending more time watching ads then actual game play,3
Is there an add free version on android yet? The ios version has one...,3
It was a fun game to play but it kept glitching.,3
Ma gan da,3
There are tons of ads in it,3
Its a very fun game but play it too much starts to get boring have a nice day 😴❤️,3
This is a lot of fun game but frankly it's just a time-waster. I just don't know if I would recommend it because of all the ads. Every battle with 30-second ad and any type of upgrade to your Tower with a 1-minute ad. So roughly almost half of the time you're just watching ads.,3
It was fun. I personally lost interest. Several times mid game it would be really glitchy.,3
It's fun but too many add's,3
"Good game ,really excited but hang and ads some problem i give only 3 stars",3
Fun,3
"pretty fun to play but could use more sound effects, music, and skins",3
It is super game i like this game,3
Game is very short lived and unfinished? Like why do we earn diamonds with no way to spend them? It's fun sorta but it's repetitive with no known goal other then make it through the track. After unlocking all the skins there is nothing to work towards,3
"It's a quite fun game. I could play more before uninstalling if wasn't for so many ads... I don't mind watching ad to get perks... now, have to watch the ""so called 5 seconds"" ads every single game is painful. Thanks for the run guys... bye",3
Too many ads,3
The game is great but too many ads.,3
My baby loves it,3
"TLDR: don't watch the ads, just close and reopen the game every time. It's faster. I don't mind the repetitiveness like a lot of others do, though I also wouldn't mind the level design being changed up every once in a while. The ads after every round are stupid though, especially since they're usually longer than the rounds themselves. I'll probably end up modding the game to remove ads eventually, but for now, simply restarting the game instead of watching the ads is the way to go.",3
"This game is quite interesting for me. It's just that if you play it many times you will definitely get bored. And if you want to play this game without showing ads, you have to turn off your data first.",3
"As a game fun, but lot adds, less then 2min I unistalled it.",3
I will try,3
"Fun liitle game 5*, a little glitchy and froze once had to uninstall -1.5 = 3.5*, TONS of ads -1.5 = 2*, ads have some good games to play +1 = 3*. ( could be a -2 for all the ads) 2.5 * overall.",3
I COULD really enjoy this game but there are a lot of glitches that happen often and cause the game to freeze at the end of the board and even tho you've beat the guy at the end you don't get credit for it and have to close the game out and restart it. And that happens A LOT,3
"Once you go offline, it's fun, but gosh, way too easy. I haven't lost a single time and stopped at level 69.. because I ran out of battery... So unless you suck at maths, this game is mostly moving left and right, no difficulty whatsoever... I'd recommend removing the walls from the edges, making more +/x choices instead of just +5 or +100 .... And get creative to make this a funnier game... The whole diamonds things has no interest at all lol. It has some potential to be a fun game..",3
Fun but way too many adverts . If you can bare with adverts then it not a bad little game.,3
"Dam a kom man a vlo,Kakoli furniture",3
"Fun, too many ads",3
"Was good. Ad heavy, turned on aeroplane mode to combat this. Completed the us but game goes no further. Being uninstalled now as no more incentive to play",3
Bad,3
Bad optimization..,3
"Count Masters is a sample though involving casual game. The gameplay loop is simple, you control a crowd running through a stage and attempt to grow it as much as possible. Though the game gets repetitive quickly and is frequently interrupted by ads. Progression also ends quickly as most things can be unlocked by viewing an ad. I'd say it is a good way to pass time if you have nothing else to do and hope that the developer may go on to make better games in the future. -SM",3
Same game way..a little bored,3
"It wasn't to bad, but it lagged a lot, and when I watched an ad for something it didn't give it to me at all that's the only reason I am giving it three stars",3
Too many adds,3
"Entertaining for about 5mins but ther are a lot of adverts and not much difficulty or change to gameplay/achievement so fairly quick to lose interest. A solid ""meh"".",3
Wow this game is very merry Intrested,3
It's good so fae but the adds are just a lot,3
Too many adds between levels,3
Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi,3
Super,3
it's very khatarnaak,3
Nice,3
Fun but an ad after each level is a but annoying,3
"Kinda fun but waaay to many adds, to lagy, keeps crashing, and i erned a reword but had to watch a add to get it",3
Too many ADS,3
"Too easy, and it vibrates your phone all the tome, so it eats up your battery fast. Also turn off wifi and or mobile data because there are too many ads.",3
"It's an alright game for killing time, but I unlocked everything pretty quickly, so there wasn't much of a reason for me to play afterwards.",3
Nice idea but there is wayyyy too many ads.,3
Because of advertisement,3
Ok,3
Beautiful game..thanks ring id.,3
Too many ads. After each level and more sometimes,3
Not the best,3
"So, game is great but comes with many advertisements. Way solution to solve this is just simply turn airplane on. That's not why I gave it 3 stars. It is because of how game was set up. Control is simply, but I don't see if I could to avoid the dead, yes, even if it is small amounts. I found out it is not possible and you will have to lost some people as you play just because of lack of room, no matter if you have cat's reflex. The overall of game is ok and I recommend play it.",3
Meh,3
"Too many commercials oh, but it is a good game.",3
"Too many ads, but still a good game!",3
Joss game,3
So I've heard that this game has a lot of ads so I'm going to see how many ads are in one minute.... If it will download. Welp it didn't install.,3
I'm a good champ.,3
"I like it, it's a easy game but can you change about the skins? Like it can still claim even if you don't use wifi.",3
really fun game but ads are 30 seconds long. I get having ads... I found this game from an ad. I can't stand watching these ads and just just close this game out and start again because ads take too long. much quicker,3
"Fun, but there are too many ads.",3
Ads is too much.,3
"This game is not bad. A problem I have with it is that each time I have a lot of people it freezes my phone and my phone becomes slower, and another thing is that each time I have a lot of people it makes sure that I don't have a lot by having more obstacles that make sure I don't have a lot of people while my phone freezes (the other mistake). I have not come across any other problems so far, if I do I will then edit this review and review more. If these issues could be fixed, it would be great",3
Gets boring after a couple days.,3
It was good,3
Great game,3
Proportional oo upl lllllllllllll,3
This game boring,3
"the game is fun. i'm using a special type of adblock called airplane mode. it gets boring very fast though. i had a good 15 minutes of this game before deciding i would install something else. the game concept is interesting, though",3
"Mindless fun, too many ads",3
Good,3
Yesterday I was it and I,3
It's OK,3
This game is ok but too many ads all the things me every level. One thing that makes it better is if you turn of your wifi you should get less ads. One other thing the stairs at the end of the level that sucks because the more people you have the more it adds to the bottom layer. 3 stars,3
I love this game but sometimes there are glitches in the middle of the game so I get very annoyed but over all is is nice but if was to choose I would choose roblox over it,3
The ads were a lot,3
Too many Ads,3
This game is amazing 😃 I know there's. A BUNCH of ads but you can turn them of by turning on airplanemode or turn wifi 📴 but the reason I did 3 stars⭐⭐⭐ was cause it always lags like this game should be called (sir lags alot)🤬,3
"I like it, but why is this one so different from the iOS version? Certain parts of the game are missing like customization options and the mini game, please add them back, thank you..",3
It's ok but it would be better if you could change the sensitivity on the game.,3
💤✌,3
"I wouldn't recommed this game at all, Ita glitchy and laggy and ive had about 10 adverts up to now and only been playing for 10 minutes!!!!",3
It was nice I got amogus skin,3
"I like this game, but it's not really difficult at all. It seems to get more challenging as time goes. I just started playing and time will tell.",3
I like the app but it vibrate so much and it descharged my phone faster,3
I hate how there's ads every 2 seconds but it's a fun game,3
Too many ads!,3
Many ads,3
Waaaaaaay too many ads. Like an over amount,3
Interesting ideal fora fun easy game but it was too glitchy for me too be able to play right,3
Fun little game but there is an ad every time you tap/interact. Very tedious.,3
It's a rarity to see a game that actually plays like the adverts for it suggest ... It's just a shame that you end up spending more time watching endless adverts for other games which are sod all like the adverts than actually playing this one. Fun little game but gets repetitive very quickly,3
OK but really glitchy. Skips and studders alot,3
Way too many ads. Uninstalled,3
Please fix the bugs. Game is nice but lot's of bugs.,3
Yyy,3
Meh,3
No ads if you guys turn off your wifi and play (your welcome),3
Doesn't progress in difficulty so got bored quick,3
Game lags so much,3
If I could give 3 stars I would...,3
Lots of ads but they are short so that's at least good. But homing arrows? Literally arrows that change direction so no matter where you move you get hit? That's what pissed me off,3
"This is completely add-miner program disguised as very simple game... Fun at first, got boring over time... Try it if you wish, but never ever watch any ads to boost..",3
Ads block game,3
This game is addictive and easy to use and learn maths easy way but the reason I gave it 3 stars it is because after playing for few hours it glitches soo badly if you have a large army. When it glitches I just wait and then it says you failed the level like seriously? Other wise it is the best game I will recommend if the glitch is fix. For the ad to stop all you have to do is turn off your wifi.,3
Nice,3
Good game,3
Reduce ads just a bit,3
"To many ads, a long ads that go through 3 screens of count downs. I had to Uninstaller this the ads p!$$ed me off so bad. I couldn't stand it.",3
Awesome fun game when I'm bored,3
Fun to play but the ads get on my nerves.,3
I found it very fun but it lags a bit and I cant skip ads.😔,3
Too many advertisements are putting me off.,3
Nice,3
Funny game but to many bugs in it A lot of time when you get to the end the game freezes up,3
"Good game, I just wish the amount of time spent playing the game was more than the time spent watching ads. 10 seconds of game, 30 second ad, 15 seconds of game, 30 second ad. Uninstalled.",3
Very nice game,3
"So I like the game, however there is no point. You get coins and diamonds however after unlocking all the skins and beating the build there is nothing else you can do. The levels don't get harder so after a while there isn't anything new to add to the experience. I had fun playing but there isn't a reason to anymore because there's no challenge",3
Fun game cool game when bored!,3
Good,3
"Cringe and too easy, might unninstall",3
Ok,3
It a good game but it is glichy And A LOT of ads,3
"Good game to keep you busy for 2-3 days. It is repetitive and presents very little challenges, thus gets boring. Also, why offer the option of having a relatively large amount of the figures if they can't be made to go around the obstacles?",3
"Fun, but a lot of ads if you are playing online. It was fun for the first bit, but then got repetative. It would be cool if the levels got longer or more interesting as you played",3
The adds ruined my mood,3
Tira,3
Thek thak h,3
This Game is good...but If you get many idles run..Example : 201 idles... The game is Lag .. I hope this issue Can fixed..,3
"Great game, you are teaching so many kids counting in a fun way! But there are a few small flaws. 1. There are way too many ads, you could do a little less. 2. It is very glitchy in game and you may not get the addition you moved your finger to. Other than this, wonderful job! Keep it up.",3
got ads from gtestyt,3
"Super,😁😂😃😄😅😆😗😗😘😍😎😊😚☺🙂😍😍😍😎😋😋😎😍😍☺😋😎",3
Was alright until I started getting ads mid game.,3
It's a blue fish,3
its cool but it has too much adds :(,3
It's ok but after time it will be boring,3
Good,3
"I just started playing this game. I'm a little confused as to what the island is for, and the purpose behind ""building"" on the island. But I'm having fun.",3
"Although this game is addictively fun, there are some problems with this game (aside from having too many ads): 1. After collecting more than 5000 gems, the gems becomes useless after when you use them for building everything on the island. 2. Too many obstacles in many levels, which prevents the chance of gathering 300 units without losing. 3. Also, there are no power ups to destroy or get through the obstacles I hope you can improve this without any refusals whatsoever.",3
I had fun playing but what's making me pissed off is that there's always a long ad after each level.,3
"It was an ok game but too many ads, you cant get new skins without watching an ad",3
Good and bad,3
Sweet game,3
💕💕💕💕💕 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷,3
I like it 👍👍👍 👍👍,3
so many ads,3
"Cute game just way to many ads. I get it, you guys need to make money by running them after each level? Really? Deleting",3
It's a good game if the ads allow us to play,3
A little laggy sometimes but otjerwise it is a good game,3
Not the worst but not the best,3
"The ads stick everytime and won't finish. It makes me want to uninstall the game. I'll give the ""debuggers"" some time to fix it. If there's no fix, there's no game IMHO. Please fix the issue. I really want to enjoy the game.",3
Lots of ads. Quickly gained all territories and then its just the same thing over and over.,3
Eh. Its ok I played for a while and it was easy TOO EASY. Tho i recomend when ur bored but overall. Fun,3
The game is good but one thing I wish for the game is to remove the vibration and ads.,3
simple,3
This game is lots of fun but there are way too many ads. I've gotten an ad for every level I played.,3
Cool love this game,3
It is ok,3
Good game but far too many ads.,3
Fine but the adds r inappropriate:(,3
Super,3
good 3,3
"It's a good game, but theres not much to do when you get all the skins and finish your build. But its still a great game.",3
The game is fun at all but you can't control the speed and the obstacles are not dodgeable and that's stupid,3
Ezxz I stay in,3
It would be better if there wasn't so many commercials and on occasion it freezes so you can't move out of the way of objects,3
"It seems like a good game, but I can't play it, my phone is very jammed, you guys give it a try.",3
Nice,3
It's fun I guess 😁,3
"Nice game 🎮. But only one problem that this game includes only few obstacles. So, every level contains same obstacles. Hence, this game becomes boring 😑 . So, I gave it 3 stars ⭐⭐⭐",3
"It's an interesting concept but lacks much difficulty. I'm 30 levels in and I've died twice - both instances of which being merely due to me being an idiot. As opposed to the level system, I'd recommend more of a temple run-esque how long can you keep going format which may be more interesting Also the game gets really laggy once you go above ~200 And finally whilst I understand you need to make some revenue from this, I get an advert after every other level + the banner ads which is too much.",3
……✓★,3
Fine,3
Wi-Fi don't work,3
Okay but too much ad's,3
"Mildly interesting game. It's almost impossible to not win every level, making the limited upgrades completely unimportant. You have to exit the app and reopen it constantly to stop the relentless onslaught of ads.",3
Nice game,3
Nice,3
Too much ads,3
Too Many Ads the ads interrupt the fun of the game,3
This game would be awesome and addictive of not for the ads. There are SOOO many. Drives me nuts where I can't play!,3
Too many ads!! But its a great game.,3
It's nice,3
زفت,3
🥴,3
It's cool 😎😎,3
I download it for fun but i just finished the game so i have it 3 stars,3
Played for 10 minutes and got fed up of adds for adds sake. Good game though just can't put up with so many adds.,3
Good,3
Its a fun game its just if i get a really big number of people it gliches and laggs so i have to get off of it,3
It is taking so long to upload,3
FOUND IT A LITTLE BORING.,3
Not bad,3
Fun game. Too many ads. Ends when too easy.,3
It's not a terrible game if you turn your internet off. But at the same time some levels are just impossible (which is so they can't show you another add) and then you retry and suddenly it's possible.,3
Good game but wayyy to many adverts !!!,3
Another game that makes you sit through an ad after every level? No thank you.,3
"Fun game but needs a version without ads which fans can support the game with too, also the Zone game mode needs to expand to across the world. There's potential being wasted here.",3
"Fun, but too demanding for mobile. Would work better on desktop where more GPU power is available to handle the large numbers of on screen objects.",3
Ffg,3
Jk Op,3
Decent,3
"Addictive but completed all in less than 4 hours should have more land to conquer more skins harder levels and bosses, yeah its free and yeah it's fun just could do with more was let down wanted a crown lmao just summat to say your king of the world haha.",3
👍,3
"Ads are not the worst problem, when you disable network access to the app, it still shows some, but not after every single level. But game itself is lazily created, after 100 levels, I don't see it going anywhere or progressing. It would be nice easy time killer if developers would give it some thought and love ( maybe jump over obstacles with double tap etc)",3
Adzki,3
Good,3
It's kinda like a children game but it's fun to play,3
"Not a bad game! Pros: 1. Simplicity - I love how this game is just so addictive and simple to play. 2. Customization - Not terrible, like the variation of characters. I always use the Bear skin. Cons: 1. Advertisements - I play this game on my tablet, so I turn off wifi for this game. If you don't like the ads, just turn off wifi or turn on airplane mode. It's a fun game with too many ads.",3
"The game is decent but the ads placement is super annoying. You basically have to click on an ad to get back to the game. And the ad links opens up in your normal browser, not incognito.",3
Good I guess,3
Too much advertising,3
Either Enemy,3
😑😐🤫😡🌛🌜👽🧠🗣️🦵🦴👳,3
"Game is good, very ASMR type. But uninstalling it just cause wayyyy too many ADS!! Add no ADS option.",3
Too many ads But game is playable in Airplane mode as ads go away.,3
not bad if you play with your internet off,3
°▽°,3
Adds....,3
"The game itself is pretty cool, but the amount of ads is crazy. For every level that lasts a few seconds, you get a 30 second ad, then anything you do between levels, like build, unlock a skin, etc., another ad.",3
This is a amazing game i love this game and there are no ads at all....... I love this game,3
Way too many ads!,3
I would have rated it a 5 but after you do a sertain amount of things it gets extremely boring,3
What's the point of the Dimonds?,3
"This is a good game overall. Great ideas, gameplay and graphics. There's just one problem: the lag is a bit much? If you are able to, please fix this issue.",3
3 because 1 game 1 add it really iritating,3
Still getting to know the game.,3
Really fun game but there are heaps of ads and they go for ages,3
"After you build everything on the island, it gets kinda boring. Graphics are great, though",3
Ads,3
"Its a surprisingly good game, but it needs to be optimized a lot. The game becomes basically unplayable when there are more than 200 people",3
the game is good but there are a lot of ads,3
Pretty fun,3
Like it,3
This is most gregous game i like this that's why i gave 5 star,3
Boring,3
Very nice games,3
cool game.. would be 4 maybe 5 star if it wasn't for the ads every time 😔,3
Good night,3
"The game is alot of fun but after every level there's an ad,, honestly sooooo many ads",3
Good game just don't like that u have to watch adds to build ur castel,3
Fun way too much ads,3
Nice game. Too many ads.,3
It is an very good game I think,3
"Funny little game for a few hours but with a lot of ads. And what is annoying me more than that is that Ive created a village in 3 hours, got all of the skins and now the game is pointless. Would not recommend.",2
Macht Spaß aber die viele Werbung nimmt jede Lust wieder zu kommen,2
Ads after every level!,2
It lags when you get more people. Makes it really hard to play.,2
Have many advertisment🤨,2
Good,2
The game is not bad but always when i get to 200 or above the game lag.,2
Its really laggy,2
Great if you love ads. You get an ad between each short level and sometimes you can't even skip them. It's just too frustrating and detracts from the rest.,2
to much adverts while playing,2
"The game itself is fun and the graphics are pretty nice, but the ad greed is absolutely obnoxious. You get ads after every 1-2 levels. So after less than 60 seconds of playing you get a 30 second ad (although some are skippable). After every few levels there are also gigantic bonuses that you have to watch a video to get. Which, in my opinion, is fine but if you're gonna do that, there shouldn't be any ads on top of that. It feels like I spent more time watching ads than playing the game.",2
It's really not all that exciting. There are a lot of ads involved. Just kinda boring..,2
This game has mad glitching issues!!,2
Good game overall but you could calm down with the adds a little,2
Had to many adds,2
Too much ads with no option to remove ads for a small payment like other games. Uninstalled.,2
Лагает и очень много рекламы между короткими уровнями,2
Fun concept and levels but yet again another app with short levels and adds longer than game play makes it not worth even playing,2
Waaaaaaay too many ads.,2
Really? An add every 30 seconds. what a waste,2
OK except for ads. Gameplay isnt challenging but can while away some time.,2
It's interesting but there are too many ads which breaks my focus,2
Ads,2
"Game is good but doest have enough ads, you should take the next step and give us ads on every tap 👌",2
Kept freezing or going super fast. Was actually ok to begin with then all of a sudden its constant unskippable 30 seconds plus ads.,2
"Nothing to spend diamonds on. I've upgraded the city fully, and now I'm just collecting diamonds. Can't even convert them to coins to upgrade the runners. I like the game but there's nothing more to advance to.",2
"Decent however, the game lacks progression. I had 8040 gems which I couldn't do anything with. I would've thought you'd be able to purchase more island and build but there's just the one. It's also annoying how many as incentives there are to get more starting characters. I get you need to make money but damn. If there was more ways to progress through the game, something to actually work towards, I'd be more interested and inclined to play as it's a good game (barring the faults).",2
"Aesthetically pleasing game. While I understand that ads get the developers money... An add after every round, and after every unit/in game upgrade is a little much. Probably 3 times more ad time than there is game time.",2
So beautiful,2
About 300% more adds then acceptable.,2
"Look elsewhere if your iq is more than 2 digits. Game provides no challenge at all, mainly because they want you to keep doing easy levels to get ads after each one.",2
Too many ads. There was more ad time than play time. I uninstalled it.,2
Too many ads,2
Concept is fun but entirely too many ads.,2
"piss easy, not fun, didn't lose once.",2
"Good potential for fun, lousy implementation with ads playing more than the actual game and no option to get rid of them by paying or otherwise",2
Great idea BUT levels are very short then you get a much longer advert. Too many adverts and not enough gameplay.,2
This is fun but continual ads after every level makes it dull,2
So,2
Tons of long ads,2
Each level last about 20 secs then you have to watch an advert for 30 secs. Gets boring waiting for the adverts to finish.,2
Full of ads avoid,2
Very lag,2
Ads after every level very annoying.,2
"I rated this game 2 stars because you cant lose. I had 30 people up against 70 and I won, also when you attack you cant lose I get that you have to have gems but why? Also after a boss fight it gives you a wheel if you say next level it puts you an a ad anyway. The only reason I rated this game 2 stars is because of the level stages.",2
"Game would be fun but it's a ridiculous amount of ads. Do one level ad, start a level ad, want to level up? You guessed it ad. Less ads would be better",2
Bit boring not fun really,2
Wish the game play was longer than the actual ads. Lost interest after 5 minutes of playing.,2
Game would be cool if they didn't make it super easy so you keep playing just so you'll watch their 30 sec ads after your 15 sec run every round.,2
The other reviews are correct. You spend more time watching videos in this game than you do playing. The videos have to play through before the x shows up and you can safely close them without getting sent to google play and reloading the game to resume. Game play is short and hard to control. Cute concept but frustrating to play. Uninstalled within an hour.,2
Not quite what I was hoping for. You're running thru obstacles to add people to your group for various fights and fatalities. There is a guaranteed ad after every level.,2
I spent more time watching ads than I did playing the actual game... Would be good if it weren't for that.,2
good game but I'm getting irritate while playing this game too many blades and I can't get more than 5,2
My gosh the ads. Most I've seen for a game.,2
Vijay,2
Ad overload! You don't make money off of ads if people uninstall your game after 3 rounds because the ad ratio is unbearable.,2
moycayang muah 😘,2
Jana ha you know when I'm almost home🏠,2
I dont get this game. It baffles me. Bot because its hard but because its so easy and pointless. Where is the effort. I dont understand it. And the ads. If you must tirn off your data because the ads will make you suicidal,2
Please please please make this games out of ad i can't play the game its 90% is advertisements so please you make good games but the ad make people bored please 2 star is enough fo ad game,2
Play with off data ads will not come,2
Game full of ads and glitches..,2
Okay but not challenging. The choice between gates doesn't make you think enough. You always have little over 100 guys so you'll always end up around 4.6-5.0 on the stairs at the end. If I had more guys the traps and pits would be harder as well. It's never too close in a fight with red guys to worry. And the guys in the towers with arrows...those arrows don't do anything at all. Only arrows from guys on the ground. This game could be so much better. And why am I building things on an island?,2
"Too many adds to enjoy. I understand they need to make their money but LITERALLY after EVERY game there is an add, you have to wait to ""skip"" it and then wait to actually close it..... could be a fun game but not currently worth it.",2
Fun game. WAY too many ads.,2
"Way too many ads, despite okay gameplay. The multiplier appears to mean nothing and there is virtually no skill involved. Would not recommend unless you love watching ads.",2
Sleep gutted GG needs it for I have no idea what I asked yyyyyyy a la casa de mi mamá y Adri están en la casa de mi mamá y Adri ya yyyyyyy a la casa de mi mamá y Adri están en la casa de mi mamá y Adri están en la casa de mi mamá y Adri están en la casa de mi mamá y Adri,2
It takes one minute to start?😑😠,2
SO LAGGY!!!,2
"I really enjoy playing this game but the amount of ads is disappointing, it takes away the fun of the game. And its the same ads over and over again",2
Nice game but annoying ads after every level completion.. I am out..,2
"This game is really fun, but the number and length of ads sucks all the fun out of it.",2
"Pretty boring, moves fast so you have to click quick. Not sure why you need new skin, yet the ads aren't any worse than any other game",2
It's boring,2
Game sucks. A monkey can play it.,2
Ads too frequent - fun game to kill time but not worth the frequency of the ads - which is after every 1 minute of game play roughly. Uninstalled,2
"Fun and easy game, but too many ads and the levels don't get harder after each level. This game feels like it was made to make you watch ads instead of having an actual game to play.",2
Long ads after every short level. Longer ads than levels... 2 dtars because it's a fun game,2
"I would give it 5 stars, if I could skip the long ads. I would even PAY to get the ads off, but unfortunately there's no option. Would love to give you guys the rating you deserve.",2
The amount of ads is excessive.,2
"Sorta fun but very repetitive, quite laggy even on a decent phone... And way to many ads.",2
Can't stand the ads. I've never seen so many. Uninstalled after 5 mins.,2
"If this game had one quarter of the ads it does. It would be ok. It's pretty simple, as long as you choose the highest multiplier you pretty much don't have to worry about the pluses. It's essentially just an ad player. Ok for wasting 10 minutes here and there.",2
Add bomb,2
"The ads are terrible,however u can turn off the wifi and data so you won't get ads for the people annoyed.overall tho developer....do something about those ads",2
More time spent in ads than in gameplay. Ads can't be muted.,2
There is too many ads if there is a prize and click skip you still watch an add and boring both of them together is 2,2
4 games in and more time spent watching ads. Cool game tho.,2
It is fun but it kicked me of it straight away as i got on the game and i had loads of things now i cant play this game again,2
Ads kill this game. On average an ad every 18 seconds. A real shame because its a curiously satisfying game to play. Persevered through 10 levels in the hope game play would get longer - it doesn't.,2
"As a game it's fun, but unfortunately I deleted it after a few minutes of playing, because there are ads after every level. Considering the levels are all very short, the ads take up most if your time. So even though the game is fun, it's not worth the waste of time on the ads.",2
So I used to love the game and seriously never stopped playing it but recently I haven't been into it at all. It's always just the same thing now it's getting kinda boring. So it's okay at the start but then it gets pretty boring after a while.,2
This games fun and satisfying to play in off time but it's kinda shady that I watched 2 adds back to back for an extra free 100dimonds and didn't even get the 20 I earned after the level might wanna fix that,2
"To many ads. I understand we need the ads, but gets tedious if I have to have a ad after every level",2
Fun to play need newer phone tho,2
"To many ads, have to say that",2
To many ads,2
"The concept is good but the Ads are off the scale, you need to reduce this as it removes all the fun having Ads play after every round or to get an upgrade. Sort it out team",2
its fun but not my type i don't like it its really laggy FIX IT,2
"Kinda fun, but it had ads after every round.",2
😠😡🤬👎,2
Jahid,2
I ONLY INSTALLED THIS CAUSE THE AD DIDNT DO IT RIGHT NOW I AM ADDICTED,2
"I can't get past level 6, the axe guy just pushes my troops out of render and deletes them, softlocking the game. Please fix this. Thank you.",2
So many ads and its doesnt get harder or easy,2
Too many ads,2
Passes the time. Very easy. When you move to another device it does not remember your score/progress - NOT good..!!!!,2
Game is interested but full of ads and really hate it,2
This game never changes. In one part you fill a ship to go to war with different states and areas of the u.s. once you've done that. It's over. Time I reached the end 3 days. The games done.. trash,2
"Decently entertaining, but way too many ads !!",2
"To much ads, not much play",2
"Its fun but after you get in the 2nd zone and past level 50 they will no longer give you the chance to win extra blue diamonds it will say it ""loading"" but will not allow you to collect. And the ads in this game is EXTREME.",2
5 second levels with 1 minutes ads between levels annoying. I installing after 5 minutes of play,2
"Ads after every stage, clear stage in 20 to 30 seconds and ads are 30 to 90n seconds long",2
"It's a fun game, but the ads are too much. Uninstalling.",2
"Could be good, but it's 30%game 70% adds",2
Way to many ads,2
An ad after every round.,2
Great idea. Easy to use. But after every single thing there's an advert 🙄🙄 Way too many for my interest to hold.,2
"Good time waster but like all the other reviews say, way to many ads. Anything you do, you get an ad. Complete a level? Ad. Reduce the amount of ads in this game and it will be much better.",2
"Could be quite fun for a while if it was not for the huge amount of ads, and long ads at that. You spend way more time watching ads than actually playing the game.",2
"Good game, but the number of ads is insane. Probably around 30 second of unskipable ads per minute.",2
I wanted this game but I had to.. erase my game I only had one game and then I erased it and then I asked me for more erase games like. I loved the game,2
Way too many ads. You can't skip an ad unless you watch an ad.,2
Too many ads.,2
"Ads everywhere, complete a level = Ad, there's an Ad at the bottom of the screen, want to build something, there's an Ad. I know it's free but you spend more time watching ads then playing the game.",2
"Overall, this game is actually pretty fun. It's an easy and casual game to just kill some time with. However the ads are absolutely unbearable and if there was an in-app purchase to remove ads, I'd absolutely buy it. A level takes all of 30 seconds to complete and then you spend the same length of time watching an ad.",2
میتونم بگم معمولیه,2
Boring game takes time downlode ....,2
"It has a nice consept to the game, but could do with loads of improvement, there's way to many ads and you can't actually enjoy the game, also when ever I'm just going to get a high score I go to the boss fight, and then it glitches making my screen project the same animation over and over again of the people fighting but neither side takes any damage.",2
Bad game,2
Alot of ads I basically net the game in 1 day once I completed USA map.is there any other map to attack,2
Good little game if your bored and have some time to waste but if im being honest you spend more time watching adds than you do playing the game.... Shame,2
Too many ads,2
"Would be a fun game, but it freezes at the finish line all the time and there are way too many ads.. 👎🏼",2
Amazing game,2
"There is an ad after every level, which makes it so annoying to play. Had the game for 10 minutes and want to throw it.",2
Had a kinda fun 5 minutes playing but it's just a pointless game. More adds than anything and repetitive gameplay.,2
"Way too many advertisements, bloated with unnecessary features",2
"The game has potential to be fun, but the amount of ads is utterly ridiculous. After a few hours of playing I've already got all the skins and fully maxed out the island. There doesn't seem to be any purpose for the gems after building everything on the island so that part seems pointless. The game itself is fun but the ads make it so painful to play. You can bypass the ads in airplane mode, but you shouldn't have to do that in order to enjoy a game.",2
The ads are longer than the level or gameplay so this is basically a ad pumper game for them to make money... would be better if I could play but it's like 10 seconds of play and a minute of ads....,2
Very repetitive with nothing to look forward to,2
Constant ads after EVERY LEVEL.,2
It is ok but I would play so thing better,2
Really bad,2
Adds at every stage. Good game though.,2
"Interesting idea, but ruined by way too many ads",2
Wayyyyyyy WAYY tooooo mannnyyy ads!! Uninstalled🤷‍♀️,2
Too many ads,2
The game seems fun.. too many ads though :/,2
This game would be a lotire fun if it wasn't so laggy and it would be a lot easier to win if it was more better without being very laggy,2
Its so very god!,2
Tejas,2
"Too many ads, love the game but constantly have to wait for an ad to finish to carry on... No need for that many",2
"Not the worst, but boring",2
"Fun, but too many ads",2
"If you have a system wide ad blocker then play this game, otherwise don't bother. It's 250 ads per minute",2
Too much advertising,2
Too many long ads! Another good game idea ruined by long ads after every round. At least twice as much time spent on ads than playing the game.,2
Game is good I liked it much...but the ad appears in the middle of the game which I hate it🤬,2
"Ugh. Fun game, but more time spent waiting for useless ads than doing anything. Uninstall.",2
"Great game - shame about the ads! I don't mind some ads but you have to watch one after every single level, far too much in my opinion.",2
Mediocre.,2
Kinda gets boring after a while,2
"When over 50% of the game is ads, it's time to delete it.",2
"Enjoyed until I got beat by a police figure. Really why? Thousands of other things to pick from, why a cop?",2
I like it but its rigged 4.8 its every score,2
So laggy once you get over around 200 men that it's unplayable,2
Ads on every single level. Insane.,2
"The game doesn't lie about what it is. Which is to say, it's a very basic time waster with very simple mechanics, minimal progression, and a respectable amount of ads. Two stars for being basic and blah, without being an ad farm.",2
Good game but the play time to ad time ration is off. 10 seconds of play followed by 30s of ads ever time. So it's like this app is for the ads and the ads are broken apart by play time.,2
"Glitches both in game and between games when you an receive bonuses and new skins. Keeps buffering and won't load properly. My Internet is fine, so it shouldn't be glitching due to that",2
"For the love of god, let me pay you so i don't have to watch those ads, or if there is the possibility to skip them by paying make it more obvious!",2
"The game it's okay, does not have a solid (strong)goal. Also the advertisement is incredibly annoying. The idea is nice but there is a lot to improve. I'll delete it.",2
Would be fun. Too many ads to find enjoyable.,2
All ads.,2
There are way to many ads you can't even play the game.,2
It is very repetitive and sooooooo many ads its driving me insane. However it is fun and enjoyable but I had to uninstall ot because of the amount of ads.,2
TOOO MUCH ADS!!!!,2
I would enjoy you if didn't have ads after every single round. Uninstalling.,2
It's good game but It's space is much more 62 mb is more for it,2
Add after every level,2
Just too many adds....,2
Fun to pass the time,2
"It's alright. Decent time-killer. Ads are super f*king annoying though after every round to the point of uninstalling. And what the hell are the gems for? Collecting all these gems but there is nothing to use them on.....what's the point? And after sending ship to conquer the US, that's it....it doesn't go anywhere else in the world?",2
"The game is really good, but it have to many ads.",2
Cool game not bad,2
Nice game. Terribly annoying ads. Uninstalled,2
i like the game but after every round there is a advert and it is just really annoying it is ridiculous i have just git it and already had over 25 adverts only had it 5 minutes if it had less ads i would definitely recommend it.,2
Love this game,2
"Too many ads, ad after ad can't even have fun with the game uninstalled",2
I coun,2
Its kind of boring but I like the game but sudenly when I reach level 10 I feel bored so plss put alot more obstacles and more trils,2
"There's alot of ads, I finished the game in only 5 hours.",2
Ad btw every level.,2
Too Many Adds,2
Wanna try it,2
It was ok at the start but then it got boring.,2
"With all the ads, were you able to buy your mom a house with a basement for you to live in?",2
Could be fun... But waaay too many ads. I kept it for a little while because my son enjoyed it. But some ads weren't child appropriate. Have to delete.,2
"I like how in the ads, they don't show it up to the stairs but I don't like how this game is really laggy. I also don't like how when you work hard to get a new skin, you have to watch an ad to get it.",2
Boring game. (I turned off my WiFi so ads wasn't problem to me.),2
"Why do people play these games. Its a bit of mindless entertainment but if you understand basic math it loses appeal quickly. Not to mention, ads are ridiculous. I'd pay a couple dollars for no ads but holy Christ, there's a ton.",2
"This isn't even a game, it's an interactive commercial.",2
Glitches too much. I run down middle and game forces my players into the sides where they die off.,2
Its not that fun 😕,2
Ads ruined the experience.,2
So much adds😡 At first this was fun but it gets boring and pretty much every level there is an add😠,2
The levels are shorter than the ads in between,2
Fun but way to many ads. This woukd be a fine game but players spend more time looking at ads than playing the game.,2
"I5 , h",2
A great game but you are forced to watch adverts and there are many of them. You spend more time watching adverts then playing the game!,2
It's a very fun concept but in practice it is 1/3 gameplay and 2/3 ads.,2
I like wasting away my time playing these games but hate wasting it on the ads. So many ads its insane.,2
WAY TOO MANY ads. Seriously after every turn.,2
This is very best game and I am boring we will be play this game this is osm,2
Meh,2
"Could be great. This can is fun but is an ad over load. They could have at least had an ad after every couple of rounds. But nope. After every round, which is about 5-10 sec long. You have to watch at least a 30 sec ad plus any ads after you upgrade anything. Ads over load you after 4 rounds in this game. At least for me",2
Too many ads.,2
"Ok game. I'm fine with an ad or two, but man this app is out of control! Uninstalling.",2
"Fun game, but the adds are to frequent. You will spend more time watching adds than actually playing",2
Ads after every level is very annoying and in my opinion far to easy I got to level 71 without losing once.,2
An ad after every level and too easy,2
"It has bit of challenges not enough, it repeats some but different stages it does change with the traps ideally. But it will get boring fast.",2
More ads then game,2
Awkward game,2
Dont know what they are talking about this game is like a good but boring game,2
"The game is cool, but they have a lot of ads.",2
Too many ads,2
Not bad,2
"This game is lovely and fun. It has a great concept and it's probably meant to be played in short bursts. Even so, whilst I appreciate that the game is free to play, please be kind to your players and offer other options such as paying for the app to avoid ads, or just reduce the amount of ads. These many ads are just irritating and will force many to uninstall before they can get to know the game. Update...I uninstalled...life is too short to spend it watching so many ads. 🤯",2
Adds right off the bat. Annoying.,2
"I noticed a few ""this game has potential"" or ""this game COULD be fun"" among the reviews - I couldn't agree more. The ""game"" is essentially an advertisement board attached to a genuinely fun mini-game. The only issue is: for every 30 second you play, you watch a 30-second video ad. This, for me, is way too much ads. I get that the devs need to make money but if you had tweaked the ad-to-content ratio, I wouldn't have uninstalled it and you would've derived more ad revenue from me...",2
Very nice,2
Install the game..turn on Airplane Mode .enjoy the game without ads...,2
Way too many long adds that you cannot skip,2
I'd play this endlessly but it's designed to play until level 10 and then delete from your phone,2
It's ok might be a fun game if there wasn't a ad after every single level.,2
Toooooo many ads,2
So many ads waste game,2
"It's a fun game concept, but literally filled with ads. Cannot do anything without having to go thru ads.",2
Lots of ads..,2
Fun little mini game but there is no difficulty curve. Levels remain short and easy just like the first level. Not worth buying an way too much ads to play the free version.,2
"Its a fun game however,on my phone if it get higher than 200 it glitches other than that I love the game",2
Way to many advertising,2
"Game is kinda fun, but there's an ad after every single level.... very annoying.",2
Way too many ads that are very long. If it weren't for the super long ads between each level I would play but because there is more ad time than game play i have no choice but to Uninstall. Such a shame they put greed first,2
"Too many ads! Must uninstall it. Other than that, game was fun",2
"Fun simple game that might have potential but there's to many ads! After you win the level even if you don't win, there's ADS after you finish the level. The levels in this game don't even last 50 sec and then you have to go watch at least a 30 second ad. Really ridiculous.",2
Ads involved all the time,2
"I want to give it a higher score, it's a really simple yet fun game to play. However... a level lasts just a few seconds, and every level there's an unskippable ad. You earn currency which you can multiply by watching an ad, but by choosing not to multiple you're still forced into an ad. You unlock skins for free by earning enough points, which you then have to watch an ad for to actually unlock. TLDR; You're watching ads 80% of the time and only play for a few seconds at a time...",2
It dont let me play. It so bad im toge to the girl are boy how mad this game,2
Nothing new and interesting in this game.,2
"Fun and simple game, but the number of ads are rediculous. I get this is a free game, but 3 ads after every 10 second level is just too much.",2
Cool game too many ads gets annoying!!,2
Ads and ads how can you play like that,2
My screen was as lagging and after 3 hrs it still didn't stop lagging I even had like 2 gb or something,2
"Poor, too many ads. I shouldn't have to spend more time watching ads than actually playing. I might play more, and keep the game installed more to than an hour if you didn't have constant ads",2
good,2
I hate adds ther are soo alot of adds that why i gave it a two stars,2
WAYYY to many ads! 🙄,2
"The game is designed that you spend more time viewing ads than actually playing the game. Well, to grow fast at the beginning it's okay, then start Count Masters in airplane mode (offline) and PLAY THE GAME without ads. It's quite fun like that for 15-20 minutes! ;)",2
"The idea is good but how add is used, it's totally awfull! You spent more or almost more time waiting the end of the add instead of playing...",2
"Simple game yet somewhat entertaining until you realise that you don't really have any control over what happens, you can effect the outcome slightly but if the game decides that you're going to lose you will lose and there's nothing you can do about it. On another note that I seem to be saying in every review now this game has way too many ads, pretty much one between every level whether you win or lose.",2
It Mack u lag so much that it macks you die,2
"Fun game. But, the amount of ads and length of ads is utterly ridiculous. I uninstalled after playing less than 5 mins because of the ads. I would've even paid for ad-free. But, I didn't see the option anywhere.",2
It's good,2
Too much adds,2
Waaaay too many ads. Just an obscene amount of very long ads popping up extremely frequently. You'll spend 5x as s long watching ads than actually playing. Was enjoying the game but burnt out from ads too quickly. Uninstalling as soon as I'm done posting this review.,2
"Simple game, but too many adverts, some quite invasive with no close or skip option.",2
"Nice concept, to many ads, has trouble loading and that would give you new skins and allow you to make extra income and strengthen your troops. So sadly it's a massive FAIL. Not worth the download unless they fix these issues.",2
Decent game but way too many ads,2
Good game gets a bit boring but that's just preference but there is an add after every level/game not worth it,2
Enjoyed for about 2days before the ads got annoying! Way too many ads... uninstall!,2
"Game is easy to learn and interesting enough to kill the, but the ads are way too much. I understand the need for revenue but to show ads after every round is bit over the top. Unfortunately, I'm uninstalling.",2
Very short game. Yes the ads are annoying but you battle and beat the US in less than 2 days so what more is there. Playing more levels isn't exactly exciting given they are very repeatitive. Fun for a short time but not worth the long play.,2
Fun game .... to many ads ... more ads than game.,2
"The idea of the game is nice but the game is designed poorly. I played until level 40 and levels are repetitive. There is nothing new and it's boring. The difficulty of the game doesn't change. I don't understand what is the purpose of the boss fight after some levels. There are so many odd things about the game. By the way, I don't believe it's possible to get more than x5.6 multiplier in the end of any round. It just looks impossible due to obstacles.",2
game is so lag,2
Are bhai agar ads aa rahe he to nat band karke khelo na kya yaar,2
decent gane but too many ads for me,2
Hard to understand the game,2
Not very fun. Too many ads run slowing down any momentum for play and play is just basic arithmetics.,2
Repetitive,2
"Decent concept, completely ruined by the ads. Spending more time watching ads ťhan actually playing will never be entertaining",2
This game is nice but sometimes no,2
Neat simple game but ads after every single level and ads when you are just doing house keeping things. The ads are sometimes over a minute long and after only 10 seconds of gameplay makes this game a hot pile of garbage. Don't be so annoyingly greedy.,2
Not worth playing. Spend more time watching ads than actually playing. Game concept is good though,2
"Literally an ad after every level, and banner ads right in the bottom middle nearly all the time.",2
Its fun after a while but its the same thing over and over. But i know a trick to get the adds a way for free just put your wifi off. Then when you finish playing the game you put it back on again.,2
Jk7,2
"I have a few qualms with this game, and before anyone shouts at me, yes I have turned my internet off to supress the dubious amount of ads this game has. First of all, the leveling system is completely random, even replaying the same level; it's a complete roll of the dice on how well you play. Secondly, the levels are each insanely short, this makes the game a lot less challenging and fun. There also appears to be a failsafe that means you LITERALLY CAN'T REACH MAX ON THE MULTIPLIER LEVELS.",2
Way to many ads,2
So many adverse I mean I will play it if bot so many adverse but it is a good game so 2 stars sorry,2
"Its a fun game, but its impossible to get max multiplier on the blocks at the end",2
Gioca se sei un fan di stikman,2
I like it but the reason I gave it 2 stars is because there are to many ads,2
Good,2
uhm good game but gliches,2
Nah it's ok?,2
Pub hell,2
Haven't played if for 2 min but looks OK for now,2
"It was kind of fun for the first 10 minutes. I ended up unlocking all of the character skins, leveling up my stats past lvl 10 in both categories, and making it to level 100 in under 2 hours. If you want to mindlessly play the same thing over and over again this is for you.",2
"If you like watching ads, this is the game for you. They practically give you the end game if you watch enough ads. What a lame game. 2 stars just because it was entertaining enough to drop a few hours of playing.",2
"Fun, albeit mindlessly easy. I spent more time watching ads than I did actually playing the game.",2
Ad looked like a cool concept but the game doesn't function well on my phone.,2
Keeps freezing,2
Fun game when you're not watching adds,2
Fun gameplay if not for the ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS. 3 ads every round. Absurd.,2
"Although, it's a cool concept and looks good, the game is virtually unplayable given the high number of ads.",2
Too many adds,2
WAY TOO MANY adds. After a 10 second game you have to sit through 60 to 120 second ad.,2
Too many ads.,2
"Bro the game kept freezing bc of how fast i completely massacred the big boy in one of the boss battles, also it's pretty laggy",2
حلو حلو بس مو كتير؟؟؟🤮🤮🤢🤬🤬,2
It's an alright game but there are ads after every level which turns me away from it a bit.,2
Way too many adds for a just ok game. There was an add befor i beat the first level. Do not install not worth it.,2
"This game redefines how many ads are considered ok for a free game, intrusive to the point of being unpleasant. I understand it's free but this is just silly.",2
"Kinda glitchy, so far not really fun and I wish they didn't have any ads those annoy me",2
"Ya know, it's a fun game, not hard at all, but there are far too many ads. St the end of every level, and ad. If you want to collect your item(where there is no choice)an ad. If you want to try and continue the game, you have to watch an ad first. It is quick paced and fun little game but the fun seems to be taken out when you have to watch and ad every 30sec at the end of the levels",2
Meh,2
Had it for about 30 seconds. The left to right scroller was glitchy and already saw an ad.,2
"Really, really boring. Do NOT install it",2
"Good gameplay, rather monotonous and WAY TOO MANY TOO LONG ads",2
Way too many ads,2
The adverts are too intrusive,2
Wayyy too many ads....,2
Narw you. Thanks. I am .,2
More ads than gameplay,2
The most ads I've ever seen in a free to play game. You'll spend the vast majority of your time watching ads.,2
"Classic ad game: you play one stage, you watch an ad. Annoying, though a fun game (if it had less ads)",2
Constant ads basically after every level it's really annoying,2
Mostly ads. Pretty boring. Not recommended.,2
"Nice idea. I installed having read the reviews saying there were too many ads and decided to ignore. However, after 10 minutes playing it's clear I should have paid attention. There is an ad after every single level and each level only lasts 10-20 seconds. With each ad lasting at least that time, it kills any enjoyment of the game. Don't bother even trying.",2
Too many ads. I get that everyone has to make money but there's an ad after every level and it's at least 30 seconds or longer. As much fun as the game is I'm not willing to spend to that much time looking at ads.,2
Would be more fun without so many adds. An add after every level.,2
Not so good as sown in ads.,2
"I don't mind ads but this is ridiculous, uninstalled.",2
Wayyyyyyy to many ads!,2
Was pretty average bordering on okay for a while but then it started freezing up constantly and that took me out of the experience.,2
It's a fun game but it's constantly glitching and losing half or all of my people. Uninstalled because it was frustrating,2
"Too many ads, very annoying",2
Hh,2
Not that good!!,2
it was a pretty fun game until i realised the finish line shrinks your amount of people if you have +300,2
Too many adverts. Advert after every level. Uninstalling as the games takes too long to play due to adverts.,2
Hate it 😦,2
Bland and easy. Way too many ads,2
😴😡💔 I don't like the ads is dumb 😒,2
P.shana,2
Spent more time looking at ads than playing the game.,2
"I move a crowd of little people through gates to increase their number and win small battles. Then the game hangs in the third level and won't restart, though the adverts at the bottom of the screen keep going. Unimpressed.",2
"Game is actually fun, but the amount of ads is staggering...",2
A repetitive game that forces ads on you so frequently that you need to turn off your WiFi and data to play it properly. The game itself is so incredibly simple that I never failed a single level in 39 runs.,2
"The gameplay is fine, but the ads are far too frequent and cause the game to crash. That being said, the gameplay is not very creative, and feels like the same level over and over.",2
"La idea es buena pero le falta ambiente, cómo por ejemplo la música de fondo y reducir la cantidad de anuncios",2
Too many ads. Really ruins the game.,2
It's not best,2
The game itself is actually quite fun but there are way too many ads to the point where the game feels boring,2
Ads every 30 seconds and a very laggy game,2
Always advertising,2
"Initially fun, but getting an ad after every single level now. It's obnoxious.",2
"A nice game, but I didn't keep it, too much ads, everywhere!!!",2
Ads after every level. Not worth it,2
Way to many ads. Removing.,2
Nice game but many ads,2
it's a good game theirs so many ads and some are inappropriate especially since this game is for children like every single time you lose there is a 30 second ad and it's annoying. Do Not Get This Game,2
Boring,2
Way too many ads,2
"Kind of boring. Simple concept and fun for a little bit, but got old after the 15th level.",2
Very glitchy. Hard to control because it jumps about and sometimes just stopping. Disappointing,2
Played it for 10 minutes and uninstalled it. The number of adds is way too much.,2
"Mildly entertaining for all of thirty seconds, then it's an ad app with a pretty standard mini game in between",2
"Okay game play, way to many ads.... I skipped a bonus just so I didn't have to watch an ad, and it opened an ad to exit the bonus window.... Uninstalled",2
This is the wrist game in the world,2
"It's fun and all, but there is an ad after EVERY level and that makes me stop after just a few levels.... likely deleting this due amount of ads",2
"Simple and monotony, but with potential -2 star for ads watching simulator -1 star primitive gameplay",2
Good is not bad,2
Good for about 20 minutes.,2
"Too many ads. There's an ad after every level, so I spent as much time watching ads as I did playing. The game itself is fine, but I can't deal with that much time watching ads.",2
Bad,2
Great game but way too many adds. More time is spent waiting for the ads than playing the game.,2
Too many adds! Couldn't even get thru a game.,2
Oizzzz AZ,2
Too many adds more adds then game play,2
Annoying ads,2
I level ads 2 level ads,2
When I had lots of money I used it by getting more skins and I got all of them so whenever I got chests I just get money no fun this company that made the game make more skins if you are going to update,2
"So the game does what it says, it's fun, but it's way too easy. There is virtually no way to actually lose. No challenge at all so after 1 day I'm bored of it and uninstalling.",2
Every level is the same. Udea is good but execution is very bad. Gets boring after 5 minutes.,2
"Too many ads, not why i rated 2 stars but the ad for this game overestimated how hard this game is",2
Graphics are OK. Game play is the same over and over and over. You to play a couple levels back to back then you get an ad after every level,2
"At least 50% of the time your watching advertising. It's not that challenging either. Plus most obstacles can't be fully avoided. Gave 2 stars because the concept is nice, but that's about it.",2
Aah,2
Jsk,2
Too many ads . You will watch more ads then you'll play . But could be fun if wasn't for that.,2
To many advertisements,2
good game but way too many ads,2
Way too many ads.,2
Eh.,2
lazy game,2
90% adds,2
Game seems child like. Too many commercials. Spend more time on commercials than actually on the game,2
"It's a really fun game, but I had never played before in game that to actually play takes less time than watch all those advertisements.... Just uninstalled it 🤷‍♀️",2
Cool and good game but i really angry with the ads,2
Would be more fun if there wasn't a flippin ad after every single level.,2
Bhut zyda maza ki h awsome wali😄😄😄😄😄😄,2
Funny but too many comercial.. Waste of time. Uninstalled after 6 leves...,2
Good concept but the ads REALLY killed everything. Just no,2
"just dumb game, designed to make you watch ads.",2
Cool game - but a ad after every level? That's overboard. Uninstalling.,2
Shap game,2
"Every level has been played, there are always ads. Please fix the ads it was one of the reasons why the phone always getting lowbat",2
"Good game but a 30 second advert, followed by another 5 second advert about the same thing between EVERY level. I understand the need for advertising revenue but this pushes the boundaries to far for me.",2
"The idea and gameplay is nice .. unfortunately the amount of ads destroyes the gameplay a lot! It's like 15 seconds playing, 30 seconds ad .. not playable in thus current state",2
I rate this apo 🥀❤🙊🙈,2
Nice game😃😃,2
"Fun, but too many ads",2
it is nice,2
Ads ads ads ads,2
"Fun for a little bit, but then you've beat it and there's nowhere else to go.",2
Far too many ads for such a small based game spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Uninstalling,2
اللعبة فيها القليل من الاخطاء,2
"The game itself is decent, although it lacks any kind of depth in its mechanics. However, the amount of ads shown is obscene - too excessive by any measure.",2
Too much ads it's so irritating had to uninstall it,2
luv,2
I can not play this game with friends because it is a single player game only so I had to give this rating only 3 stars :) sorry It isn't a drift racing game and it is not a government simulation game either :) I am not 10+ so I don't know how to play this game so I had to give this rating 2 stars instead of 3 stars :(,2
Way too many ads to be fun. Not challenging enough either,2
It cant download in my phone huhuh,2
Stutters so much it's impossible to control the game.,2
Turn your wifi/data off. If you don't an ad pops up every 30sec / 1min. Way too often to be enjoyable.,2
Fun game. But kept shutting off my device.,2
"Fun game for a while, Too many adds ruin it. I'm going to remove it.",2
The game is exactly as advertised for once but believe the reviews about there being a thousand ads after every level. If you could disable the ads the game would actually be great,2
"The review rate is due to ad's are to often, but fun game",2
Great game! Too many ads. Ruined it for me. There were more ads than play time.,2
"This a good concept for a game, but very repetitive and boring.",2
Tiap main selalu ada iklan bikin kesel aja gbsa main dengan damai jadinya,2
Can't even play the game with all the ads,2
It's laggy and could use some work,2
"Game is pointless, good fir little kids but the ads are consistant. Uninstall",2
Hope you like watching commercials. You will play for about 10-15 secs and after every board watch a 30-60 commercial. The game itself is fun-ish. I can see getting board of it real quick. Don't waste your time scroll on.,2
Waaay too many ads. Uninstalled.,2
There is a game between ads! Uninstalling now...,2
aripsk,2
Game itself is fine but just so many unskippable ads takes the fun out of it. The ads between levels take longer to get thru than the levels themselves,2
Ok lang naman siya laruin pero naglolokohan lang lagi kasi medyo wordy siya laruin pero yung kagandahan lang sa kanya minsan nakakatanggal siya ng stress hahaha,2
"I think this game is fun.. key word ""i think""... I have spent time on this game, but i didn't actually get to play it because 80% of time are ads. Level lasts for 5 to 10 sec, and then after each level forced unskippable ad... Most are 30 sec ones.. This will backfire on you, people will try the game for few minutes and then leave forever. You make too little from ads and you can't afford to have people leave in disgust. What ever you have gotten so far, you could have had so much more..",2
Very cheaters game,2
Ads ads ads too much,2
The ads are longer than the gameplay of each level.,2
I can see fun in this. But the ads... god the ads. I cant even call them ads cause they're AIDS,2
"If you're looking for a way to waste your time, then this is the app for you. Beat a 10-15 second level, watch a 20-30 second ad. Repeat. Build on the whole island and conquer the whole map, then you're done with any extra parts of the app. Should add the option to build on the other areas of them map that you conquer and reduce the amount of ads... Even for a free app.",2
This game is 2000% more enjoyable when you turn off your wifi so the ads never come up. I completed the map of the US in less than a day & now there's nothing else to work towards. Uninstalling when my kid gets bored with it.,2
Me no no me like ad no me hate angry when game !!!,2
The game seemed fine but anytime yoi move your blue characters the game starts to lag almost like with every move the game starts sticking please fix this,2
IF I HAVE TO SEE ONE MORE DAMN ADVERTISEMENT,2
"If it wasn't for the concept, It'd be one star. Ads CONSTANTLY interrupt, you'll actually spend more time watching ads than actually playing. The gameplay is pretty barebones but it's a mobile game so I don't think that's really a big issue. Game itself is fine, the ads completely ruin it.",2
So this was fun at first. I just downloaded it. It was fine then I got to level 10 and it started getting really laggy. I wouldn't let me control it. Either the problem needs to get fixed or I wont play it. I will update on this later to see if it gets. Better. For now 2 stars.,2
"The high amount of ads out weigh the actual content in the game. I had the entire island unlocked in less than 1.5 hours. Get rid of the advertisements, add some more content, and you would have a fairly fun game.",2
Fun for 10 min,2
I've spent more time watching ads than playing the game. Shame as game could be fun to kill some time.,2
Boring,2
ADD Simulator 2021,2
"Hardly a mathematical game AT ALL Smooth, well made mechanics ruined by choosing the bigger number EXCLUSIVELY. Never Multiplication VS addition, always ""swipe for largest positive or lowest negative number"" a 6 yr old could win at this. 15 second Advertisements after every simple level.",2
"SOOO many ads! I would really enjoy this game if there wasn't an ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. It makes it so annoying, I had to uninstall it after 5 minutes of playing. Shame.",2
Not so nice but not so bad also you can play it.,2
"Far to many adverts between games, so annoying",2
"Got a couple of hours of gameplay. Beat the game, it was a meh experience and really boiled down to just a brainless decision maker. You have to play on airplane mode or the ads take up as much as half of the time spent playing. Again, it's just a ""meh"" game.",2
The amount of ads and the length of the ads is ridiculous!,2
The ads are annoying. I can't even listen to music while being distracted by ads.,2
Djsjwisieieidueueusjejejejejsjeisksjsueie is a bird gun man who knows the best way of doing this and he will never be a better friend to me at the earliest convenience and I will also be grateful if you can help me I don't help you meme but I am not egnoring to the fact that I am a not a toy you can help you meme I am a not a toy you is a 3 in a his own home and I am sorry for the inconvenience home and I will not be able to help you with the Mild challenge of your baby as I am now in back pain,2
গেমROBOT,2
Dont want to be rude but it is dum and a playd for like 10 min but wen a wanned to go to the next level it was black I went in and out fir like 30 min and stil black so ya am not being rude and that is why am only giving 2 stars so A++ for the effort please look at it Thank you 😍,2
A LOT of ads. Very hard to enjoy the game due to the number of ads between levels,2
this game is fine it is just has so much lag,2
Would be a great game if there wasn't too many ads plus constant lag to where it's not possible to get enough units for the horde,2
Too many ads. No way to reduce it.,2
Could be fun if there weren't so many ads. Pretty much every time you play a level. Even had two in a row and that was the last straw.,2
Too many ads,2
Okay game but there are sooo many ads. There are mandatory ads after every 10 second level,2
Just uninstalled the game. I enjoyed the game play it was created well however getting an ad after every single round was really starting to infuriate me to the point that I had to uninstall the game. Piss the ads off and people will love the game more.,2
Not the best game it plays for a while then at a later stage along the course it stops which causes a loss in the game and have to restart 😒,2
Too many adds,2
"You spend more time watching ads than playing, uninstalled",2
Way too many ads!!! Waste of time. Very long ads 30 sec each.,2
It is slightly good just barely ok but ads on ads Good game just decrease ads,2
Boring,2
Just way too many ads. Takes the fun out if the game. ☹️ Disappointed at all the ads.,2
It so bad I didn't like it at all u should change things inside the game,2
An advert after every level. Don't download,2
30 second ads after a 10 second game play. I mean its fun-ish but the ads are exceedingly long for the amount of gameplay you get. Because of the amount of ads its extremely slow as well.,2
الاعلانات كثيرة جدا,2
Front know how many ya start with?,2
Its full of ads. Some of which cannot be cancelled.,2
I understand the need for ads but this game just has too many.,2
"Awesome game but Plagued with ads! Now and again, ok, but every time you complete a level? And 3 of them at the same time? Makes it unplayable.",2
Too many ads,2
Nice game but too many ads. Wouldn't mind having a 5 sec ad after each round but having to wait sometimes half a minute until the next round made me loose interest.,2
"Full disclosure: this game is very easy. That makes the game a good de-stressor. Unfortunately, it has ads aplenty unless you make sure to turn off your Wi-Fi and data before you start playing. Furthermore, the game gets unstable if you amass more than 200 people at a time (something you should do often if you've passed 4th grade math). Overall, a calming game that really just needs fewer ads and more polishing.",2
It's okay but it goes pretty much the exact same kind of way,2
Advertisement after each and every level,2
"This is advertising with a little bit of a game thrown in. The game is great, but the amount of ads is obnoxious.",2
Easy. Very ad driven. Will spam ads but won't let you watch them to get the skins and stuff that you earn from the bosses.,2
Great concept but adverts after every level that last longer than the level you played kills it for me. Too greedy,2
WAY too many ads.,2
"Idea of game is good , fun to play. But getting an add after each level is very annoing. Uninstalled after 15 levels , amount of adds is unbeliveble",2
"Sometimes you can play a little, but mostly ads..",2
So many ads for a simple game not worth it,2
"Too many ads, but fun nonetheless",2
ritik Yadav,2
Adverts. Every level and even to get rewards you've earnt. Uninstalled as spent more time being forced to watch them than actually being able to play the game!,2
"Simple play, could be fun on those days ya just wanna space out and not really think... but the ads. Oh so many ads. Ad farm. Would not recommend.",2
"Ok for 10 mins, then you get fed up with ads... Yawn ..",2
Nice ads.,2
Thakur King 👑,2
To many adds,2
Fun game buy no real skill required. Lots of glitches and adverts.,2
Ads are toxic. Game is mindless.,2
"This game is pretty fun I enjoyed it but unfortunately after yet another ad, This game made my screen turn black and I couldn't exit the game I ended up restarting my phone.",2
Just wow,2
Bhkko,2
Fun concept and mostly fun game play (with a few issues) but ads after every level makes it not worth the hassle,2
Pretty lame and it repeats itself alot. Do not recommendm,2
"Potential to be a good game. It was fun to play a round or two, but expect a loud and annoying ad every time you blink!",2
The game is probably fun but it's just another advertising mess. Uninstalled after being bombarded with them.,2
Too many ads,2
Too glichie and no store to spend coins,2
For time pass very nice.,2
Woww super ugly games,2
Too many ads,2
Waaaaaay too many ads.,2
"Way too many ads, seriously 30 sec ad after every level !! Unfortunate because looked interesting, uninstalled.",2
"This is a really fun game and love the idea, massively ruined by the length and frequency if ads. And after every level or action and the ads are long .....really ruins it",2
"Sorry, good game but uninstalled after a couple levels.... not watching a 30+ sec ad after every round which only takes 5 to 10 secs max to play",2
Would have been great without so many ads.,2
Laggy,2
Idk,2
"So. Many. Ads. Now I remember why I don't download anything new, a few ads still load on airplane mode, but then it gets a little better. Fun for a hot minute.",2
"Way to many ads and boss bonus is deceiving. It says 40/60/100 than it's multiplied 2/3/5 but it never does. It says your bonus was 20, times what it lands on. That's not how it is. So the bonus is what it lands on without the multiplied amount.",2
"Fun game........but I have never seen a game with as many adds as this game, not worth it! 🤢",2
Fun game but the levels are really quick with ads in between each one so tbh it feels like you're just watching ads the whole time. Played it for about 5 mintues or less before choosing to uninstall it due to this issue.,2
TOO Many Ads....fun to play but an ad after every level is infuriating!,2
Basic medium/mainstream ad game. Good mind grabbing concept like the rest though.,2
So many ads ☹ even mid game ads. It's a fun game.. but adds made me uninstall.,2
There should be some payment option to remove the ads. Too many ads... deleted the game after 3 min.,2
"Very repetitive, boring and too easy",2
Ads left right and centre,2
Way too many adds,2
Weak game with mis leading videos.,2
The game is really fun but way to many ads and I understand that's how game developers make money but one after every round and most have no skip option it's a bit much,2
Sejal Parihar 😇😇😇,2
"Enjoyed the first few levels, but it's just repetitive now. Every level seems the same and there's an ad after literally every level",2
So so adds every level,2
It stoped while i play. It just need some more improvements.,2
Boring,2
Good but add ALOT more,2
Because when I played it was lagging alot and alot of adds,2
"It's actually fun, but not the 20 sec ads per 5 sec rounds :/",2
To many ads I'm looking at ads more than playing the game.,2
This game is nice and fun at start but it gets really boring after 2 minutes,2
Just turn off data andcwifi and no more adds lol,2
SO MANY ADS. ITS LIKE PUNISHMENT FOR PLAYING. UNINSTALLED,2
Very choppy game play. Laggy controls that cause frequent mistakes. Frustrating!!!,2
Gets boring after 5-10 mins of playing,2
"It's a quick fun game but too many ads.... Play for 10 seconds, then watch a 30 second ad between every level. That's ridiculous",2
Hey guys this game might be fun but it toooo many ads and it gets sooo glitchy that you cant even control it! so this is why I rate this game 2 stars!⭐ Annoyed regards: Viana Vinny Dehghani😣😡😠,2
"Fine, levels over quickly and long ads between each level. Uninstalled",2
"I like the game, but it is way too many ads that take longer than the game does to play...✌🏾",2
This game has a lot of potential but the amount of ads just ruins any bit of fun. I can definitely understand ad placement for a free game however there is a constant ad at the bottom of the screen and every level is followed by 15-30 second ad. Each level is about 10 seconds or less. You will spend nearly 3x more time watching ads than playing the game.,2
"Fun game, but sometimes two to three ads between a level and the next. Sometimes it will offer you a reward if you watch a video, or skip to not get the reward, only to still be given a video just to move on. You're presented with at least one thirty-second ad for every forty-five seconds of playing. Just an ad machine. When I get back home, it'll be more fun playing since my network blocks the ads from loading.",2
"Fun, but wayyy too many ads",2
Good but it have so much ads I didn't like the ads so two stars sorry pls fix this much ads,2
The game itself is fun but the ads are constant and long. I find myself playing 2-3 rounds then closing the app because it's so annoying. Game play is way too short vs. ad time.,2
"The game is good, but too many ads! The ads are longer than gameplay...",2
I hate the game and it's really annoying the law the adverts why would you like to go with more that adverts my wondering about every level you are a catalyst add that's why it's so I not going to Rebecca do it this song allo raiding two doors ???????l?,2
"It was made only for to get money. You get an AD after every game, you can only unlock the character (after you got the 100%) with the video. The game itself is boring, it doesn't even have any music. It's just boring and bad.",2
This is literally the dumbest game ever you can't reach more than 200 people at the end because of large obstacle that will kill every one and i've reached level 402 in couple of days nothing interesting in it i lost 2 times only and that because i wasn't even focusing on the game the background ( watching tv) was more interesting,2
"Waaaaay too many ads, more ads than game honestly. Also not much gameplay.",2
Tanga-tanga kasi yung nasa ad kaya dinownload ko.,2
Es un juego aburrido It's a boring game,2
Far to many ads!,2
"So glitchy, lots of ads 😒",2
Ok,2
"Might be fun, but how would I know. There is an ad between every level, and ads between build, or attack. Not short ads either, 30 sec ads. Ridiculous, annoying, and not worth the effort. Uninstaller after 5 levels",2
Could be fun if there was room to move,2
"Like the game...but every time you finish one sequence there are ads, ads,ads,ads,ads I've seen them so often and the ad time has 3 sequences before they finish. The same ones over and over. I hate them and would never download them. Im about ready to uninstall this game because of the ads.",2
Too much adds,2
Nearly as much ad time as game time.,2
To many ads,2
Eh,2
I hate math LOL,2
It's just too many ads. Uninstalled.,2
It is pretty easy and it has to many ads,2
"The game has potential to be a silly fun time waster like Hole.io of Crowd City But the problem is it puts ads after every level, and the levels aren't that wrong. The play/ad balance is all wrong.",2
"I don't know why I keep downloading games that I see in advertisements. None of them are ever playable. I really want to enjoy this game because it's really fun, but the fact that I have to watch an ad after every single level is ridiculous, and I'm not going to keep playing something that I can't enjoy.",2
The game itsself is simple yet addictive HOWEVER there are more adds than game play. Cut down your adds by at least 50%,2
Why on earth is this game so laggy? Tryed playing it on a LG G6 and it ran terribly.,2
Click bait,2
The levels take about 15-20 seconds and each one is followed by a 30 second ad,2
Two stars Why?I Have every Skin and I like how you have to fight In different zones!But sometimes you get a level that looks like the same level you fought and you have to fight the same bosses and i have a lot of Gems so i have nothing to spend them on😒😒😒😒,2
"There are ads after every single round, which last less than a minute each. Plus, the only thing you can unlock are new skins and even then you have to watch an ad in order to get the skin you worked for. It works fine, although easy, but the excess of ads makes it pointless to play.",2
"The concept behind this game is good, but there really is minimal skill involved. Its really simple to chose the best path and if you get alot of units, there are no way to avoid losing some on the obsticals. There are ramps that also only allow a certain number of units and it just makes you go ""what is the point, the game is very limited"" This game is also too comercialised.",2
Usual 09,2
Too many ads ruins it. I spent more time waiting for ads to run than actual gameplay.,2
"The game is fun at times and the controls are simple. The main issue with this game is that there is no way to avoid the obstacles if you have about 300 of those little blue people. It is possible to reach the end with about 200 blue people although it is unlikely because it depends on how many obstacles you have. This makes the game feel more luck based rather than skill based, which prevents players from ever improving.",2
Great till it crashed,2
this is children game ................... I. LOVE. THIS. GAME. I LOVE YOU,2
"Sooooo many ads, game doesn't fit on the screen properly. Graphics are smooth at least. No idea how this is a top rated game.",2
Too many ads! Just boring.,2
It is a okay game to play if you are bored but the ads are too much,2
Game itself is cool but completely ruined by the shocking amount of ads inbetween EVERY round.,2
"Ads are unbearable, more of them than gameplay..",2
It was fun at first but got slowly boring,2
It's a time killer. Coins aren't actually necessary. Nothing changes the outcome if you level up or not. Would be nice if ads weren't so frequent.,2
Try making the game harder and make it endless,2
i would give it a 5 stars but to many adds..EVERYTIME i do a level i get an add and its unfair for me bc im on a chrome book snd i have to exit out and go back in the app because a add. 2 stars..,2
"Game is alright, but if you play for 15min, you're watching 14min of ads. Such a shame. It makes the game unplayable...deleted",2
Its very laggy but good game,2
Could be fun. Just way too many ads to even get to enjoy the game.,2
Game is fun but levels last 10 to 20 seconds and after each level you need to watch a 30 second unskipable ad. So I spent more time watching ads then actually playing.,2
Way too many ads. I know the app is free but an after every level. Good game besides that.,2
"Very likable but an insane amount of adverts. It's fun to play but the games are very short and the constant bombardment of adverts makes three whole thing, ultimately, unenjoyable. I hope the Devs enjoy the money they've made from my 27 minutes of screen time (12 playing, 15 adverts).",2
Fun for about 30 minutes. Wish thr levels got longer as you played. Too short.,2
"Game is fun, but each level takes 10 seconds and then you have to watch ads you can't skip. I spent twice as much time watching ads as playing",2
Omg,2
I love you,2
"Absolutely ridiculous levels of adverts, spend more time watching them than the game",2
"It's fun, it's super simple, it is mindless time wasting, which sometimes it all you need/want. But for crying out loud please give me the option to give you some money to get rid of the eternal ads.",2
Achha nahi laga,2
"Maybe it's a nice game, maybe not. Didn't get through all the ads to get to know. 10-15 seconds for the first level, 1 ad, 10-15 seconds for the 2nd level, another ad. That's definitely too much.",2
"this was awful every level you had to watch an add and it is so terrible, I deleted it in 20 minutes.",2
"Mildly fun, repetitive, not challenging",2
Nice concept but the quantity and duration of ads is insane.,2
"To many ads, ads every 10-20secs of gaming but its fun game tho wish there was a ad blocker or an option to buy so it would be ad free",2
Tooooo many adds. Too Greedy. 1 or 2 adds after few levels is ok. I will be deleting this app just cause of that.,2
Quite a good game but the adverts are soooo off putting. I get they make their money with ads but there are so many I'm deleting this game because it's that annoying. There are other games where the forced adverts aren't as often and I feel like It's an ok trade off but this one is longgggg,2
Fun game but more advertising than actual game play.,2
To laggy to many adds,2
reslly laggy too many ads,2
Dai to play do. Not play the game ko dro but I ply this game Verry good game,2
"It's a good game. However the stages are kinda small and there's another thing. IT IS OVER LAGGING when you have a big number of ""helpers-soliders"". Please fix this!",2
The games great but the ads are HORRIBLE WAAAAAY TOO MANY! Im leaving.,2
After u get over 150 it get really lagey,2
"Could actually be a great game if I spent less than 60% of the time watching ads. It is a very simple but fun concept but you get an ad after every level, even if there is an offer to get an upgrade in exchange for watching an ad and you click no you still have to watch an ad. (And you don't get the upgrade) seriously if the developer decreased the amount of ads they would have a lot more regular players as the amount of ads for me (and many many others I am sure) is ridiculous(will uninstall)",2
"Ads, the levels take 3 seconds then you have to watch an ad for 2 minutes",2
"This game is quite good but whenever I'm reaching 400 above it satrts lagging, which is irritating.",2
Too many ads. The game play is shorter than the adds you have to watch between each run super annoying. Otherwise it's a good game. Uninstalled due to ads,2
Somewhat decent albeit repetitive game tarnished by way too many ads,2
The ads are so annoying. The only thing good about this game is the satisfication.,2
"Forced to watch add at the end of EACH LEVEL. Fun game, but nope.",2
Really annoying short game breaks between ads. Just let me watch ads without interruptions -- you are almost there anyway,2
Open this,2
Would be addictive af if not for an ad between each 10 second level,2
To. Many. Adds.,2
"Fun, but way too many ads.",2
More ads then play time,2
"Ad after every single level plus an ad to get skins and stuff you already collected coins for. Also, in my experience it starts lagging a lot once your army grows over a certain number, and some traps can't be fully avoided if the group is large.",2
Some time killing aspects but the game fakes a reward box at the end of some runs but you can only earn 300 tokens and can only get other rewards after you watch an ad.,2
Fun gameplay but insane amount of ads,2
Eunice Koena the 33,2
It has way to many ads all the fun stuff comes with ads but the main reason I give it only two stars is because there is no actual reason to be playing the game like there is no backstory after about two rounds you will be bored because it doesn't make sense like why are you fighting these huge people thingys or avoiding this or trying to ad characters what good will it do?ರ_ರ(ー_ー゛),2
Vbg3,2
I have played plenty of android games and understand the common use of Ads but I don't think I have played an Android game which is as Ad heavy as this one. Very disappointing and spoils an overwise enjoyable game.,2
"To many ads. Fun, but Not worth it",2
Game takes ages to load and crashes lots. 👎,2
Irritating because I never get 7.0. But game needs more updates,2
"Okay, this game ain't too bad but once you build everything in the city the diamonds are basically useless. I don't really see the point in earning diamonds and you can't spend it.",2
To many ads 1 after each level thats a bit to much in my opinon.,2
"Game is fun and easy, it gets laggy the more people you collect. The worst part about it though is the ads after every level.",2
The game itself is a good simple fun game that you could mindlessly play for a while. The ads are absolutely out of control though. The levels last like 10 seconds then you have to watch a 30 second ad then they advertise the whole level at the bottom then they find other opportunities for 30 second ads. The game is clearly a cash grab.,2
Fun for a short time. Way too many ads,2
Way too many ads. 30 sec ads after every level.,2
Good game. But to many ads,2
"Well the ads don't show up if you put your device on airplane mode. Besides that, the game is really easy and repetitive, there's really no point to keep on playing. Even if you fail a level, the redo of that level is completely different, which makes me think each level is randomly generated anyways, and defeats the point of having any levels. The levels are all really easy to pass if you swipe your crowd away from the obstacles and to the highest numbers. Not challenging. Gets repetitive",2
Too many ads.The ads start while Im playing :/,2
The game is a good design but it also glitches a lot. Turn graphics down.,2
Very nice,2
Has loads of potential but far too easy and it doesn't get challenging or interesting for far too long time,2
Very fun game but 2 stars because the levels are short but the catch is you having to watch an ad after every level!!! This is really annoying.,2
Too many ads,2
Fun game. Unplayable due to ad time. No thanks.,2
It was lagey,2
Like it,2
The game is fun but the ads are brutally annoying. Stay away.,2
Fun game but each level takes less time to complete than the ad you have to watch at the end of it.,2
Way too many ads,2
My favorite part is how it's rigged so you can never exceed 5.0 combo at the end of each level 😍😍😍,2
there are some glitches in the game.,2
Super laggy I'm talking like 12 fps and there's ads every two seconds. It might be fun if I could actually play it.,2
You have to do math and slot of people suck math.,2
Im going to probly bee rateing this app wen it tells me too rate it if i like soooo am give it a 2 STAR,2
"Installed it, uninstalled it after 25 minutes of playing. Cool game, but waaaay too much ads. And they're way too long.",2
👍👍👍,2
too many ads.,2
Too many ads!!! More ad time then play time. Ad after every level too much for me. Other then that could be a good game,2
Super lagging.,2
"Too many ads As others have said, good fun but to have an ad in between every stage (which takes about 20 seconds) is too much. Uninstalled!",2
Oversaturated with ads.,2
SUPER,2
"Too many unnecessary ads. Ads once in a while is fine, you get unskippable ads every level, theres no way to enjoy the game like that!",2
Adds after every level and they are twice as long as the level. Download if you like to watch adds.,2
🍋🍐🍑🍏🍓🍐🥝🍎🌰🥖🌰🌰🥜🥜🥜,2
İf you wanna waste your time download it...,2
No many ads,2
Yeah no its very laggy,2
"Game is cool. Need to cut adds back to being optional bonuses, not the majority of your game.",2
Every time you play a challenge it follows with an add,2
Fine game but an ad after every level is kind of annoying,2
All this is a game hidden inside of an advertising service,2
"Far too many adverts, one at every level means you're spending more time watching an ad than completing the level. Uninstalled.",2
To many ads,2
Kind of absurd,2
A bit pointless for those who cant do basic math,2
Non stop ads,2
It's not very good main good,2
"Great game. Would be a fun little time passer/casual addiction, but there are too many ads. You can't click a button without getting stuck watching several video ads. Uninstalled after a few frustrating minutes.",2
To much ads,2
"This one takes advantage of just about every little trick they could possibly use to cheat the player. It is a very thinly veiled ad revenue machine, as every level lasts a few seconds, ends with an ad, and currency means all but nothing since almost everything can be achieved by watching a full length ad instead. 2 stars because it at least plays the way it looks in its own ad, though it doesn't get any more complicated than that.",2
"As one of the review mentioned - to many ads (in general ads can be in the game in case you want some extra content, not after every 15 seconds level). The game is too easy, no counting challenge (usually choosing between adding 2 or multiplying by 2). The story can be finished in no time (after less then hour the map is cleared, I have a lot of gems and I have nothing to buy with them).",2
Veery bad,2
Ads...,2
Way too many ads,2
The ads are longer than the game segments. Wow monitization taken to a new level.,2
Very good appp 😘😘😘😘😚😚😚😚😍😍😍😋😋😋,2
Wayyyyy too many ads,2
Adds after every level way too much,2
Too much laggy,2
it's alright,2
"What an awesome concept. You get navigate through an endless universe of adds....each one attempting to trick you into hitting the wrong button to send you to the install link, or sometimes even locking up the game. The most annoying part is the actual levels between ads. Remove the levels and I'll give it 5 stars. Lol",2
Ok game just way too many ads.,2
Too many ads like after each lvl their is an ad.Some ads are 30 seds and you cant skip.,2
Way too many ads The game could potentially benefit by turning off ads for the first 10 minutes you play. The game could also benefit from creating a better user experience for the ads. Currently the ads interrupt and slow down gameplay which is a huge problem. You've got to get people excited about your game before you just pelt them with ads,2
It was fun for a bit. But once you build everything and conquer America there is no further to advance,2
Way too many ads.,2
"Game ok, but too many ads. At level 3 I had spent more time watching ads than playing the game.",2
Too many commercials.,2
"game concept is good, but more ad time than game time",2
Fun for a while. Adds after every damn level get old fast. Deleted,2
K like do not want to download because the game is Candice 😂,2
"Tried to download it says, it doesn't want deleted games for this game that has 3.7☆. Which really I dont like.",2
More time spent watching ads than paying the game. Not exaggerating.,2
Bad,2
"I like the concept, but the game lags and the ads are constant.",2
It's a very fun game however why should I have to start over from the beginning every time I exit out of the game and come back it's pointless??? And the ads are ridiculous!!!!!,2
Good game for children nice👌✌️,2
I quite enjoy the game but as everyone says the number of ads is insane,2
Far too many ad's to make this game enjoyable. I'd say make this game 59p without ad's and I'll re-install,2
"Fun game, too many ads :(",2
"This game would be so much fun if I didn't have to spend MORE time watching ADs then actually enjoying the game. I wanted to stay up and play an addictive game, not pass out in boredom 😪",2
These games would be so good and fun but the devs have to keep it up but is spamming ads the best way to make people play? No its not how do you expect people to play when you spam ads,2
"Nice game, way too many ads. The ads basically make the game unplayable.",2
Seems like a nice game but deleted in the first few seconds because of the ads. But I guess u made some money from my download.,2
SO MUCH ADS!,2
"I made myself play through well over 500 levels. By now I've been through most everything. The levels never get harder. I only failed 2 levels and it was due to just stopping mid level, not because I couldn't keep up or anything. I built myself an ad blocker at home, so in game ads aren't an issue for me here. On the go, I play offline. And when online other places, there were a lot of ads that came up. There isn't much to the game. Good for killing part of an afternoon, when offline though.",2
So many full screen ads means you spend more time waiting to play the game than you do playing it.,2
"Game isn't that bad. It works well, it's cute and is a fun time waster. However in the hour I've played I've spent at least half that time, maybe more waiting through ads. It ruins an overall solid game",2
Just not challenging enough. Repetitive and the levels don't get harder. Uninstalling now,2
Have you guys tried playing on Airplane mode? I guess it gets rid of a lot of adds,2
Ads every game 🤬,2
Too many ads. Gets boring quickly.,2
"Game is Okey, ads are making this unplayable.",2
"Decent game and I understand ""free"" means ads. But, after every level, no thanks. A 15 second level then 30 seconds trying to move is not worth my time",2
This game is alright but I spend more time watching ads then actully playing the game so I wood give this game 2 satars,2
Its fun dor a little while but then it starts getting repetitive. Im not sure if it's just my phone but While playing It was very laggy.,2
The game is really fun I love to play it but it freezes up so bad you can't control the little players half the time I'm just going to uninstall it's not worth the headache you guys should really look into that,2
"I don't mind that there is an ad after every level, I get it.. you have to get paid for a free app. My issue is.. the short levels, then after every level the ads, then to upgrade you have to watch an ad.. like, the game is fun.. make it longer.. until then, uninstalling.",2
More ads than gameplay. Would be fun if it was a more consistent gameplay.,2
"You can't actually get the top modifier, even if you have a maximum amount of troops they just disappear during the counting up phase, with 200 or 300 troops, the max is always 6.2. The bosses are also the easiest part of the game, which is pretty anticlimactic.",2
Amount of ads will kill someone,2
It's just funny for 10 minutes and then get boring 💤 and repeating again and again,2
TOO MANY BLOODY ADS,2
It's still boring,2
"Hey you! Yes, you! Do you want to watch ads with mild interruptions of a surprisingly bland and simple gameplay? Then oh boy is this a game for you!",2
An OK game. But who's going to play it if there is more time spent on watching ads than actually playing the game? Is it logical to have a 30 s add after every level which BTW only lasts 10 s? Uninstalled.. Not interested in your greediness,2
"This game was horrible, I will never play again",2
Even though the idea ia cool - stages a way too short and you spend more time watching ads that actually playing :/,2
Repetitive,2
"Tha game is interesting, but so basic plus they are too much ads",2
"Boring. Absolutely boring. This app is just another ""ad mining"" app. Nothing more.",2
Waaay too many ads,2
Too much ads,2
Very lagy,2
Too many adds,2
"Too many ads, no way to even turn them off with purchase that I could find. Not worth it. Would pay a few bucks to turn off ads, but spent more time on ads than the game.",2
annoying... watching advertisements more than to play,2
I must say I thought this game would be better like it's super easy and kinda boring. There aren't to many ads which is good but all you do swipe the screen to the higher number. If you want to be entertained I would not recommend this game.,2
"WAY TO MANY ADS. It's more watching ads than playing because the levels are so short, and there's an ad after every level, without fail.",2
Good game but WAY to many adverts! Theres one after each round!,2
boring,2
"Way too many ads! I completely understand making revenue by being ad-supported, but literally an ad after every level is ridiculous. The only reason it's not a 1 star review is that most of the ads can be skipped fairly quickly. Shame, because otherwise it's a fun little game.",2
Its alright to start with then becomes repetitive and boring with ads every other second.,2
"The game play in this app is simple and entertaining. My problem is after 10 minutes of play there was almost 4 minutes of game play and over 4 minutes of advertisements. The remaining time was due to extras things within the game. This is very unusual for games I normally play, its normally 30% ads to 70% game play. Thats alot of time wasted on ads. Won't be keeping the game.",2
Play for 5 seconds then watch a 30 second ad. No thanks. Uninstalled,2
The game is alright but it's level - ad - level - ad. There's just to many,2
Decently fun but too many ads. Levels are quick and there's an ad after every level.,2
Good game but the amount of adverts is ridiculous puts you right off playing it,2
When you finally get loads of people it lags bad so you can never get a high score.,2
Adds,2
Game is not bad. The Ads however are from the moment you install it and until you decide they are too many that you have to uninstall it,2
Forced ads,2
Is ok,2
"Too many adds, it's practically unplayable",2
"Way too many adds, like 2 adds after each level",2
X is best,2
Count Masters,2
"I really wanted to play this, but there were too many ads!",2
Boring,2
Maybe for young kids practicing basic math.,2
Download it only if you want to see an ad after EVERY single game,2
"Dull but a great way to see loads of stupid, irrelevant ads.",2
"Too many long adds, pass more time in adds then playing by far... Got bored.",2
Game round last 10 seconds followed by a minute of adverts.Anorher profit driven pile of C,2
"Truly wierd, slow with bad quality. Multipliers are simple, no logic made whatsoever. And it gets boring",2
Excellent game super,2
"Game is okay but too many ads. It's understandable that the ads are required to earn profit. But it's more like Ads with game, not game with ads. 1 mint stage and then 3 minutes ads.. Uninstalling it right now.",2
The ads in this game is ridiculously many... Every round ads? Bruh i like when Games dont have ads back then... Btw the game is great... dont like ads,2
"For all of you saying that it has too many ads, turn off your WiFi, and then no ads, also i had 600 stick men, and it deleted some and I couldn't get over x6.2 it's stupid 😔",2
Yes it's fun but too many ads flashing every after the game. So annoying,2
Unplayable due to ads. Uninstalled within seconds.,2
Your average mobile game.,2
So bad,2
So boring🙈,2
"I'm pretty sure they made this game lag on purpose. It's very easy to play and easy to get high rewards, so their solution to keep you from winning is to play an ad after every single level and make the game as laggy as possible so you can't avoid obstacles or go through high earning gates. A shame because if not for the lag I would really enjoy this game.",2
Ďxźxż,2
good,2
"The ads are ridiculous, good enough gameplay but ads take longer than the game itself",2
Very very laggy and to much ads. Was not enjoyable.,2
It's a very cute nonsense game but lags too much,2
Game is fun but you get ads after every level. Levels are 5- 10 seconds. Ads are at least 15. Bad balance to me.,2
"A lot of the content doesn't load, it says you can win more gem.or change skins but they never load so you have to opt to lose them. I have also completed the island and there doesn't seem to be a next one or a reason to keep collecting gems.",2
Too many adds,2
"Ads, Ads, Ads. More Ads than game play.",2
Ganda tanga,2
Would enjoy the game but the lag when you build the troops up is unbelievable. Sorry but games aren't enjoyable like that.,2
Op,2
Nice game,2
Att ggfb gghgvbt tg b£,2
However you pooper they kick th buddy,2
To many adds,2
It's not the best game because it is fun but I think it needs to be gone.,2
its a fun game but all the ads ruin it,2
"It's fun BUT THE ADS RUIN IT SO MUCH. It makes you watch 20-45 seconds long ads after every run, regardless if you press the 'watch ad to triple your reward' button or not, which defeats the purpose of that button. The devs will FORCE you to watch a long ad anyway, regardless if you want the extra reward or not. If you don't press the 'watch ad' button, you don't get the extra reward anyway for watching an ad, which is the devs' way to say ""haha, **** you!""",2
I read how everyone is complaining about the amount of ads that are displayed. So I play in airplane mode. BAM! No ads. But I won't give 5* because I have to turn on airplane mode.,2
"This game is fun to pass time, but it's major downfall is the ads. One ad after every single level is frustrating.",2
"Good game, but 50% play time, and 50% ads. After every level is an ad... Way too much. Thanks, but no thanks.",2
So adds,2
Gameplay is fine but there are lots of ads. There's one after every level which last about 35-40 seconds.,2
It is not as fun as the ads made it look. It also gets pretty old fast.,2
Fun but too many ads,2
"Nice and light gameplay, but gaming experience is significantly lowered by an extreme amount of ads.",2
I like it but when it comes to ads I hate it,2
Crowd,2
Way too many ads,2
"Very simple game fun to kill a bit of time, people weren't exaggerating about the number of adds though. I didn't mind however they are very buggy adds, if the crypto card one plays it crashes the game every single time just leave you in a blank screen forcing you to restart your whole phone. They should probably check this add and remove it if it's not programmed correctly.",2
Would be a fun game if not for the overabundance of ads.,2
I need more ads...,2
More ad time than play time.,2
This game is best game but too many adds is coming,2
Fun game but too many ads kills it,2
Not. Ads. A. Ads. Bad. Ads. Game. Ads. In. Ads. Theory. Ads. But. Ads. It. Ads. Has. Ads. A. Ads. Slight. Ads. Problem. Ads. With. Ads. It's. Ads. Model. Ads. You. Ads. Have. Ads. Very. Ads. Slow. Ads. Between. Ads. Every. Ads. Level. Ads. Also. Ads. Too. Ads. Many. Ads. Ads.,2
Non stop ads.,2
"Extremely ad heavy game. Can definitely use some more challenging levels. Would have loved if you had better control over the figures, like being able to slow them down or make them go faster.",2
Good Game But I Win the game 1 AD Are Here,2
way too many ads,2
The game is fine. But an ad after every thing you do is a bit too much and not worth it.,2
"With the free version, the ads take a lot more of your time than the game play. As far as I can tell, the game doesn't get any harder than the 10th level or so.",2
"Ads, ads, and more ads. 90% advertising, 10% actual gameplay",2
"Enough ads already, chumps! ADS every 5 seconds. This really is agitating to deal with and very condoning. Very annoying game.",2
More ad time than game time. Would happily pay to remove all the ads,2
Damn ads and more ads,2
There is a game in these ads,2
Incredibly repetitive and more time spent watching ads than playing. Don't bother with it.,2
"It's alright but it's super laggy if you get much more than 100 stick men then it will glitch out and you will have to reload it, and there are ads every few seconds.",2
The game has broke on my phone please fjx that,2
eh,2
weird ok game but there's literally more time spent looking at ads than actually playing the game,2
"Fun, but too many ads. An ad after every level (approximately 1 every 45 seconds).",2
गिम 🍑🍇🍆🍆🍄🍐🥓🥔🌽🍍🍍🍊🍏🍊🍒🍑🍎🍋🥕🍋🍋🍋🇦🇨🇦🇲🇦🇿🇧🇲🇧🇪🇦🇷🎌,2
Too much add's,2
I was enjoying the game but the ads were too much. One after every level.,2
First of all it's got a potential of a great game...but too many excessive ads kills the fun...it's really annoying....just cut off the ads a little bit...than it's gonna be a great game,2
Ok,2
I like the concept but Jesus Christ the adverts take longer each time than the levels. Ridiculous. Uninstalled.,2
To many ada,2
It's a fun game. Pretty simple until you get about 250 guys and then it goes into warp speed and gets super sensitive. Plus after I finished the first island there doesn't seem to be anything else to do. There are only 9 different skins to get. After completing all the extra stuff it gets pretty boring.,2
To many commercials it's annoying!!!,2
Worst game ever For Real!,2
"The game was so laggy and sensitive. I would move the tiniest bit, and I would go sooooooooooooooo far that way because of the obstacles. What didn't help was the lagging. One second I would be on the left, next second I'm on the right. Really difficult to control. If these were fixed, I would play again. Until then, make wise decisions.",2
Needs to be built differently and needs less Ads. 30 Seconds of Ads for 30 Seconds of gameplay is just awful,2
Fun but no sounds....just vibration...and ads all the Dam time. Big no for me..,2
Technically really fun... but whoever thought it was a good idea to put an ad after every round (which is usually only around 10-15 seconds) was clearly an idiot. I suggest that gets dealt with because all it does is drive away most people who would enjoy it,2
When you go up the stairs it like herts my head.,2
Way too frequent ads. Uninstalling.,2
Way to many ads,2
Wow the amount of ads is the reason I uninstalled,2
The game play is decent; while the idea is amazing. But there are just way too many ads before and after each level.,2
I kind of don't like it when the game interrupts my ad watching.,2
This is a great game but the adds every time you finish a level a add comes up and its do annoying and also its realy going fast so say you want to go to 50+ but you go to 1× its resly fast so i would recommend to play a diffrent game so i give it a 3 stars,2
It would be a fun game but its really laggy,2
"Fun game, but you get a 30 second ad after each level which is only about 20 seconds long. Too much ad to game ratio for me.",2
Ads... Soooo many ads...,2
"The game is amusing. The ads are not. 10 seconds of play, then 20 seconds of ads. 10 seconds of play, followed by30 seconds of ads. 10 more seconds of play, another 30 seconds of ads. See the pattern? Deleted.",2
Far too many adverts,2
Too many ads,2
It's addicting but it's the adds and it's sooooooo laggy,2
"In my phone, Count Masters says ""Count Masters keeps stopping,"" everytime, everyday.",2
Nice way to waist time but every click generated an add,2
Tausif,2
Good game play for a while but seems to me very repetitive and really easy to clear each level. Too many adverts which are at the end of most levels. Some of the ads never go to a skip and worse play through then just hang not letting you exit back to the game. The advert in particular was for PensionBee. All this puts me off playing again unless I'm really bored,2
"Is ok, just gets really old after awhile, and there are other games like this that are more fun",2
A great game but i just wish the levels to be longer,2
Way too many adds for how short the levels are. This game wastes time.,2
"Not the worst. I personally don't like it because it's super laggy , and the speed is way to fast. When the lag and speed mix together it just doesn't work well. I don't know if it's like that for me only, but it's just not my favorite game I have.",2
"I haven't quite seen the problem with ads, but my problem is the really bad EXTREME lag. It sucks and ruins the whole game. Don't waste your time.",2
Too many ads!!!,2
This game is good,2
Literally 10 seconds of playing then 30 seconds of ads. Repeatedly.,2
"Nice idea, shame about the ads after every level meaning you spend more than half the time Spent on the app watching them.",2
"I actually enjoyed this game - liked the on-the-fly math, dug the concept. Fun overall, eh? Especially because I was playing offline But then I realized that you can't lose? If I don't have enough guys to overpower the other side, I won't lose any people. The worst is when 2 of my characters defeated 60 enemies no problem It's such a weird minor thing, but it negated what little game play there was",2
"Fun game, but so many ads. It's an ad after you do anything.",2
"Game somewhat enjoyable. Dont get me wrong, it's nothing crazy but hey who doesn't love watching stickmen fight each other. Sadly completely ruined by the non stop ads. One every few levels may be fine, and I'd completely understand just for additional items but after every 20 second level? Beyond a joke. Tldr: Avoid this game, theres better stuff out there!",2
"Short levels and an add after every run, uninstalled after 3 runs",2
Locked up during a commercials in the first few min. Too many commercials.,2
"Too many ads, bugs and glitches. This app needs fixes",2
"The ads are ridiculous! I've played other games before that don't have this many. Also, the game becomes very repetitive and mundane.",2
Usuy👌,2
ADS ADS ADS,2
I am on level 300 and I CANNOT get to the top of the stairs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never have and I never will. Deleting rn,2
The first 10 minutes of actual gameplay are fun. Once you unlock all the characters there simply isn't *anything* to do,2
I got bored,2
Multiple Ads after every level . Too much and too distracting. Very simple game play. Could be good.,2
"Endured countless adds just for the sake of seeing if there's anything at the end. Then, at the end, nothing happens. You've unlocked everything there is to unlock (a few skins, some buildings and the USA), but there are no ""end credits"", or some way to show the accomplishment. The game just continues aimlessly, infinitely. There, I saved some curious people some time. 2 stars because you can at least change the colors of your minions.",2
"Gets boring after a few minutes and won't let you get over a certain number, just kills a bunch before you get to the end. Not enough challenge and a bit repetitive",2
Good luck,2
Way too many apps. Should only play ads after boss fight.,2
"Fun, but it's not worth it due to amount of ads.",2
No music or any sound,2
I play 5 secs and get a 30 sec ad,2
"This Game Is Good And I Highly Recommend This Game But.. There's A Loose End, Ads The Most Annoying Thing, There's A Add After Every Level, So Please Fix That, And They Also Could Try Add More Characters Because I've Collected Them All. I Don't Know Why, But Every Game This Company Makes, Always Has A Bit Of Latency (Ping) And Adds, I'm Not Tryna Hate Because They Do Make Very Enjoyable Games, So That's Why Have Rated It A 2! Have A Awesome Day!!",2
ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS WHY IN THE DO YOU HAVE ADS.TODAY I COUNTED 132 ADS LIKE BRUHH THIS GAME IS NOT RECOMMENDED LIKE DUDE ADSSSSSSS,2
"Kinda rigged cuz im aiming for x6 but when its a x6 worthy it gives a bonus round, aka a thing where it doesnt give a multiplication.",2
Pretty bad,2
Way too many ads.,2
Not interesting,2
Would give a better review if you didn't get so many adds 1 after every level is way to much only just installed and now uninstalling now to many adds,2
Too many ads.needs to wait every level,2
Didn't love it.,2
Not better,2
Super game 🎮,2
Played for a few days. Filled the whole America map then there's nothing else to do but play the same repetitive game. Amassed a ton of gold and diamonds but nothing to spend it on. Oh and I don't think anyone's mentioned all the ads.... 😂,2
I like game.,2
Its a good game but once you reach a high number the game starts glitching,2
More ads than gameplay,2
An ad after every single run is way too many ads to put up with.,2
The ads are unreal. Every 10-15 seconds depending on how quick the level is. No thanks,2
"The game play is simple and passes the time, but the end of level ads are flawed and often don't finish. There's no ""back"" or ""close"" button appearing, meaning you have to force close the game, which means you don't get your rewards for completing the previous level.",2
really fun to play but really laggy(please fix bugs),2
I like this time waster style bit there are just way too many ads. 1 lengthy ad between each level. Uninstalled,2
Commercials take longer than the levels and there are alot of them,2
It's too easy. You just pick the one that would give you more. That's it.,2
The game is really bad because the ads,2
It was boring,2
"Way too much ads, and no place to quit the game without accidentally also tapping the bottom banner add. Poor taste forcing ads so much.",2
Too easy and too many ads.,2
Nice looking,2
Too many ads 😣,2
Way too many ads. There's literally an ad every level so you spend more time watching ads than you do playing.,2
"Played for 3 or 4 levels. It's a catchy little game and of course I knew it would be riddled with ads, but seriously.... the ads are incessant and make it totally unplayable. Uninstalled within 10 minutes of downloading. Thanks anyway.",2
Es la misma dificultad siempre.,2
Very nice game,2
太多廣告，很掃興,2
There is soooooo much ads!!!,2
Ad plays after every mission...very annoying. Sometimes the missions are 10s long and you have to sit through an ad for longer 😂 uninstall,2
"Solid graphics and satisfying haptics don't make up for the simplistic gameplay, repeated levels, and lackluster controls. Ads every two levels don't help the experience.",2
ششض برم را ج د اد,2
If you want a ad game feel free to play. Unless you pay to remove the ads. It is a cute game ruin by publicity.,2
Too many ad,2
Good game but a ridiculous amount of adverts. Banners and long ads at the end of every single run. Deleted.,2
Too much ads..........,2
Same runs mostly every level gets boring quickly but could be a good game.. To samey,2
Becomes boring quickly. Makes sure you do not achieve high scores,2
Too easy and mindless. Lots and lots of ads,2
Good,2
"Too many ads, but fun",2
"It's OK. It's good for time pass, After every level there is an ad",2
"It's an OK game but an ad after every level gets a bit much, did a couple of levels and got fed up having an ad after each one. I understand its a free game but an ad after 2 or 3 leve ls yeah",2
"Fun, but there are so many ads it's virtually unplayable.",2
"The ads get old real fast. The game itself keeps entertained but way too many ads, come on!!!",2
You literally fight for absolutely nothing after gaining all the skins.,2
Nice game bhai,2
Fun. Ad after every run. Too bad.,2
Soo...many...adds...and no advancement of levels,2
Ad after each level that plays LONGER than the levels take to beat.,2
Really fun game but absolutely ruined by the constant ads,2
"Game itself is fun, but it's virtually unplayable with the sheet amount of ads",2
"I feel like I agree to the 1 star's pain, but 2 stars should be enough despite that there is 1 ad (2 for every skin unlock) every level, and the game crashes on me for every 7 or 8 levels completed. And if you watch the ads from playing a different game, it felt cringe to me. If you were to have a better star rating, please nerf the ads that we can watch less, and fix the bugs that the game crashes on any moment.",2
Hope you like adverts.,2
"Its ok, but there is WAY TO MANY ADS.Its just one of those games with the simple modles.",2
Game seems fun. But there's an ad at the end of each level and each level is only 45sec long.,2
Good game,2
"1jzjc5ka5xwkac5ehkqc6wjxexykak5xejqh4ceme. Et3cwkextja r.tvzewc33÷*4-÷*#="" jej😡😮😢hdwjaksjcrkwkwkwhtcrcsajalaojwf4crx4xevakektczy7xycwjwk4l5c",2
Great game but too many ads and after the fifth ad the game crashes my pixel it just goes to black screen. The only way to get back is to reboot my phone,2
"Kind of fun game. Having a huge problem with the ads though. Oddly enough, the ads that give no game benefits come through fine. But the ads for more level income, for new character skins and all other benefits just don't load, ever. I've waited for literal minutes at time. But again never a delay for the non- beneficial ads.",2
Kind of funny but WAAAAYYY too many ads. Spoils the fun big time. 1 in 3 ads could be acceptable but they are almost at any stage of the game. Sucks! 2 stars and uninstalled,2
"Each level consists of about 20 seconds of gameplay, followed by 20 seconds of adds. If that does not bother you, you will love the game",2
Pooja,2
30 seconds play vs 2 minute ads....nice game though,2
This game has a lot of ads and it is not Challenger then it looks,2
Ggehheu,2
Ads ads ads had to delete,2
To many ads,2
"Fun idea, the ad after every single level is super annoying.",2
Yoyo,2
Very dirty game,2
I don't really like the game because it is a killing game so like basically if you don't have enough people we all die witch is horrible,2
Good game but way to laggy,2
If levels were much longer and more challenging I would have rated it higher,2
Too many adds,2
Too much add,2
I enjoy the game better offline but after playing many many hours. I learned no one can hit past 150 with the people. So a waste of time but would be more fun with less objects killing them off every time. IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PAST 160 PEOPLE,2
👎🏻,2
I'm enjoying but it's borrng,2
ads interrupt gameplay. uninstall,2
Too much ads,2
Too many adverts. I didnt last past the first level because I was too frustrated with seeing candy crush adverts that last longer than the game. Boring.,2
Game is too easy and very repetitive,2
"It is good game. But there is a lot of problems. There are ads too. When a lot number of them(who run) the phone is hang, not fight. So, I give it 2 star⭐⭐",2
Not that good so so many ads,2
Way too many ads... sort of fun but not worth it unless high as gas watching reruns,2
"Fully 50% of time is ads. Actual game play is great, but it's 30seconds play then 30seconds of forced ads. No thank you.",2
Log,2
Ads after every level.,2
Decent gameplay but unbearable amount of adds,2
Too easy,2
"There are ads after every, single level!",2
"Cool idea, but unplayable because of to many ads.",2
Its a good game to get ur mind off things but the amount of ads annoy me to the point where I stopped playing,2
"The interesting, but the Ads is annoying.",2
Too many ads,2
Good game but so many ads!!,2
Its good,2
"I tried it out and thought it was a simple but fun game, except there was more ad-play than gameplay. When the ads take up more time than the time spent playing, it's not worth it anymore. I know ""free"" games need the revenue from the ads, but when they're dominating the time spent in the app and driving users away, you need to rethink your setup.",2
Free 🔥 fire,2
Nice bit of fun while you wait for the next advert.,2
Too many waste adds,2
This game is good 👍 but not that good,2
"Could be a great game, but it's actually an ad watching app.",2
Good game with lots of ads and repetitive levels and no challenge,2
Boring and slow controls,2
Don't like that you have to accept terms and agreements to play a game.,2
"Would have given it more stars if there were not to many ads, every single min as comes up, and the worst part is you can't close the ad if you don't want it. There are some ads which you can close but the the close button is not visible at all, one may continue watching the whole ad like a fool.",2
"Could be a fun game if it wasn't plagued by ads. Starts you off with skipable ones occasionally, then boom, every level has a 20-45 second ad.",2
Fun but in the end too many ads!,2
Too many ads.,2
Boring,2
idk,2
Another good game in play store with to much ads,2
Sort a way to not watch the ads absolutely ridiculous nobody wants to watch them waste of time and very annoying why people uninstall,2
the controls are aggravating and there was a lot of lag. now i know why this needs to be advertised so heavily.,2
I'll keep this simple. Any app that forces its user to watch an ad after each round of gameplay is trash and that's what this game is.,2
Verry laggy and to many ads,2
Not very enjoyable,2
Fun but adverts after every single level that last as long as the level you just did ruins it. Uninstalled,2
"Pretty enjoyable and intriguing to play. However, after I installed this app, this lagged my device so heavily that it was freezing every few seconds. After uninstalling it, this problem persists. This was not an issue until I installed this app in the first place",2
Constant ads,2
It's so bland,2
Fun but far too many 30 sec ads at least one each level.,2
LAKSHYA,2
Too many ads.,2
Too much adds,2
Too. Many. Ads. It really ruins the experience when everything has to be done by watching an ad. Would not recommend.,2
would be 5 stars but sooooooo many ads,2
"As may poeple have stated this is ads, with a game. It's fun that's for sure; when you can play. I played for 5mins was drowning in ads. It's a shame.",2
There's to much adds like I just want to play the game,2
"The game's concept is really cool and the gameplay is fun. But the ads. The ads are never ending. Every level ends with an ad, or two. I don't see a way to get rid of them.",2
Read reviews and decided to give it a try. I loaded on my tablet since that is where I play my games. It is not optimized for my tablet but most games work well anyway. My biggest issue is my group of little men will jump to either right or left after a battle and makes it hard to pick a direction. I will be uninstalling.,2
"It's mildly entertaining, and it's educational. However, you have to watch a 30 second ad for every reward, plus a 15 second ad after every level. It's too many ads.",2
Fun time wasting game. Way too many ads. Every completed level you get a advert straight after. Had to turn off the Internet to actually get through sind levels!,2
"Too many ads. I get it's free to v play and you need ads to get your money, but do you really need one after every 20 seconds of gameplay?",2
"Simple game that passes time but like all phone games, the ads are longer then the play time.",2
Too many ads,2
To many ads and its WAY to laggy it is a fun game but i can barley play it without a lag or an ad but its up to you if u get it,2
Game would be fun if not for an ad after every single dang level I get you need ads in your game but having an ad after every level and on top of that after every third level you have a timed ad I recommend not downloading it,2
Ads way to often.. could be good otherwise. Dont be so greedy.,2
Its not the best to me i don't like it sorry,2
Kinda fun to play but seems impossible to lose. If the opponents outnumber you then it doesn't seem to matter as you just defeat them anyway 🤷,2
"Слишком уж много рекламы. Я смотрю рекламу столько же, сколько играю. Понятно, что все хотят денег, но это перебор.",2
"Cool idea but still a lame game. Definitely better after patching out ads with Lucky Patcher, and I completed it in one sitting. Would recommend to play for like 10 minutes max, there's no award for completion",2
Too many ads,2
"Medium fun with overloaded adds, it got deleted after 10min of playing. If you want to watch over and over the same boring adds, go for it. With less adds I'd give it 4 stars!",2
My mouth hurts,2
Boring game at level one and didnt get any better after that. The deal breaker is there is no way to exit the game until it wants you to leave. The ads get in the way of the shutdown/exit buttons on my android.,2
"So many ads, so much potential, so lacking in substance.",2
"Fun but the ad to playing time ratio is really bad. About 8 seconds of play time then 30 seconds of ads, some which you can skip after 10 secs.",2
Super,2
I love it but adds after every single time you do anything is anoying,2
"That was quick, done in an hour or less I finished the map and and the island what's next? Continueous fighting?",2
Too many ads. Ads after every round.,2
"The game itself is fun but the CONSTANT ads are infuriating. It's not just after every level, it's after everything you do and it's how you unlock items. The constant stream of ads sucks the enjoyment out of the game.",2
"I will give 5 star for game but while playing game to many ads playing. I'm deleted the game, so much irritation with ads",2
I was looking forward to playing this game. So annoying that after every level completion there's an add. It's ridiculous.,2
"Poor little game, and boring",2
So many ads. The ads take almost as much time as the game. After every level there are ads.,2
It's just the same thing over and over again + No sound and Too many ads,2
Way to many ads borderline unplayable,2
The game is nice but it breaks several times.. it doesn't work well,2
I love it,2
1. This game is so packed with ads that even when you click to skip an ad and not get gems it still shows you an ad. 2. It was so easy to get gems I unlocked my entire island in maybe 30 minutes of gameplay and now I have so many gems piled up I have nothing else to use them on. 3. I beat the whole map almost just as fast and now all that's left is repeatedly sending my guys through gates because I guess I beat the rest of the game. 4. It's faster to reset the game than it is to sit through ads.,2
This game is laggy and there is also an ad every level. Not recommended.,2
I cant download it please fix it cus I'm sure it's a very fun game and I'd love to rate it five stars but I cant unless you fix it,2
"It can be a neat little time waster when you're actually playing the game, however, every single level has at least one ad after it - it is extremely excessive. I got maybe 10 minutes out of it before uninstalling. I get it's a free game and the developer has to make money somewhere, but the levels are incredibly short and the ads took up more of the time than the actual gameplay did.",2
Too many ads and they are very long. Not worth digging into the game to see whether it's worth buying.,2
"Filled with ads, crazy. Game is nice to play",2
Literally an ad after every level and you cant even skip them. Not worth it,2
Way too many ads.,2
Super,2
Ad simulator 2022,2
Way too many ads. Plus they last forever... have to sit thru too much to play.,2
"Game could be fun but I find that I spend more time watching ads, than actually playing the game.",2
درحد خودش خوبه,2
Too easy to win...it may bored,2
Its an ok game as soon as you pass the 3rd level it starts laging after you have more than 10 people,2
How do expect someone to play more than 10mins with all these ads? Uninstalling and kinda sad cause it had potential for more hours to be killed,2
Super adippoli game,2
AIs won't move. They just crash. Litterly everything else is unpaused. Fix that.,2
It can get super glitchy during a game which is difficult because the game mechanics move nonstop,2
The game itself is fun enough. It's great for wasting time while waiting on something. But it's getting deleted because the ads are just too much. Anything more than a 5 second ad is just annoying having to sit through multiple 30 second ads between levels is ridiculous,2
"This game has potential. It currently has too many ads and game play is too short. After a while it gets boring because it becomes a routine, it doesn't get more difficult and there is nothing new introduced. The city is so quick to build as collecting diamonds are easy. But once it's built, you accumulate diamonds but there is no purpose for it as u can no longer use it...",2
WAYYYYY TOO MUCH ADS I DONT LIKE THIS GAME EVERY TIME I GET A ROUND DONE..... AND AN AD COMES UGHH I HATE IT DONT PLAY IT,2
"Good game shocking amount of Ads. I get that developers need to make money but an Ad after every short level, really!?! For the number of Ads you would've thought there was loads of levels in build mode...4 at my count!",2
yoda,2
Well definitely the ads are so annoying... anyway this game doesnt have any special benefits,2
Concept OK but ad between every level is a real no no. I understand its your business plan but I managed 3 levels and removed it as it ruined the game,2
TOO MANY ADDS! I get they want me to pay for an add free version but every press of a button is an add! I'd be more likely to pay if I got the chance to play the game and really get into it but I can't! Just makes me stop playing the game. Otherwise would be a really great game.,2
"Whilst I did enjoy the game, the number of adverts is absolutely disgusting. Spent more time looking at a crypto wallet advert than actually playing it. Would've given it 1 star if the game wasn't fun. Absolute shame.",2
"Nowhere to go once you take over the island, plus n upgrades to the island either, hit a complete dead end",2
There is no challenge. You literally win every level. Pretty boring.,2
I give this game 2 stars because it has the POTENTIAL to be a nice little time waster. The issue isn't so much that there are so many ads. It's the mandatory ones on the main game and the attack mode. I'd happily watch more for extra items or boosts and I'd play longer as well but only I didn't have to do the same thing simply to get to the next level.,2
Too many annoying notlifications but i like it,2
"This game gets boring after playing a little bit, there are ads every minutes and it's very laggy",2
"Bro chill with the ads. You know what, carry on... uninstalling",2
Very long and excessive adds that makes this game frustrating and not worth playing!,2
Better luck next time,2
This game is amazing,2
"Time waster at best. each level is more or less the same. stopped at lv101. Basically its an advert generator. Finish a lvl-advert, open chest-advert, bonas gems-advert, lvl up-advert, build on island-advert. Actual play time per lvl 5-10 seconds. Adverts 30 seconds each.",2
An okay game even though it cheats you when you try to get a full crowd passed a blade...,2
"Very simple and easy game, and also very repetitive, nothing interesting",2
It's okay but super repetitive. Stick on an ad blocker or you'll end up frustrated by the insane amount of ads,2
Y u have any,2
"Too repetitive, at least the add is not fake",2
Too much ad,2
"The game is pretty fun to start out but after a few levels you get really bored of it, not only that but it takes up way too much storage and lags horribly when you spawn too many people. I had a whole army and they all fell of the path cause of how badly it glitched, it's kinda like trying something new you don't really like, you keep it for a while and then let it go after like a day 😅",2
Too many adds -_-,2
Nice way to pass the time if you want to see ads. But it feels there's a limit to how much you can score since the obstacles kill most of the guys.,2
Very laggy but the game itself isn't bad,2
"Good concept but bad execution, got bored within 30 minutes, terrible progression and no real feel of reward",2
"This is another one of those stupid games that you can't lose. Just keep watching those commercials and you'll keep winning, stupid. Uninstall!",2
Just wasn't worth the time.,2
Ganda cguro to,2
To many ads,2
Sooooooo many adverts! An advert after every level and the levels last around 30 seconds......do the math.,2
"The game would be OK, if you didn't spend more time watching 30 second adds, after every 10 seconds of game play. Was OK to begin with, but I can't take no more. I play games in my spare time to relax, not watch adverts. Extremely annoying. Also how do you advance after you have done stage 4 of the attack screen? No more stages seem to appear.",2
"Ads... Not to okay... Unless you want to see your least favourite as over and over, I wouldn't install this. Also I came to a castle and it glitched as I have to many people in my army",2
First run == ad ?!! Uninstall !,2
"Was a pretty decent experience until the intensity of the ads went from every other round to every round. Turned the wifi off, no internet connection to play the game. I've had my fill with it.",2
You rely on luck to get past most of the obstacles. You can't pace the units nor effectively get past a lot of hazards forcing you to lose units. Very little player control in game.,2
To many adds every time u finish a round spend more time watching adds then playing played to 100lv but was board long before once map completed in sub game nothing else to do no leader board or other no reason why u collect diamonds or gold really.,2
BURH -_-,2
Good game when you have some free time but there's TOO MANY ADS,2
Too many adverts. Game is OK but way too many adverts. Uninstalled,2
Advert masters,2
You can't keep from falling off even when you don't want to not much control on the figures,2
"I like the concept but it's unplayable, my group seems to not follow my control input.",2
The game is fun but there are too much ads,2
"Everytime I win or lose .....there a add ....no like....the game is nice nice nice, but the add in terrible",2
Great... IF you love watching ads.,2
turn on airplane mode before starting the game to avoid adds,2
Great Laggy,2
Way to many adds and overall horible but i rated it 2 stars instead of one because it killed 2 to 3 hours of my time,2
"It hangs a lot if I get more than 2 hundred .Once I got 534 so it stop , means the people on the tower they didn't came down and it stop. My whole crowd was gone because I have to close the app . Ahh still I can play ...😭👹👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿🤦🤦🤦🤦🙍🏽‍♀️🤦🤦🤦",2
Tooooo many ads... 5 mins in and i unistalled it.,2
The hame is actually ok but the adverts after every game ruin it. I would suggest to the person who made the game to add less adverts but it is a good game to get i u like wasting time. I personally wouldnt get this game again,2
It is kind of fun my problems are there is so many ads and that is just annoying. And the graphic are just terrible. Two stars I do not suggest.,2
I managed more than 12 minutes only to find out this game is only designed for people who play it for a short time. Nothing left to achieve so I've uninstalled it. Should have ad free option IMO.,2
"Enjoyable game but completely ruined by the frequency of the adverts. If it had been every four or five levels I could've lived with it. Might even have paid a couple of quid to get rid of the ads. But not watching the same ones every single level! Off to uninstall it. Shame, but you're too greedy.",2
Ad after every level.,2
Nice concept. Lots of ads. It gets boring the more you play it.,2
Chan jia rong,2
It's a nice game but I'm lagging when I'm gonna quit the game and it has some ads even I have no internet connection,2
"Ads, ads, ads,ads,ads...,1 round of game play, 30 seconds of ads. This game and publisher are the worst.",2
Too many adverts. You get about 20 seconds of gameplay then 30 seconds of ads!,2
What is the point of collecting diamonds and the build section? What can you send diamonds on?,2
Really laggy and tons of ads,2
I hate whe n th er e isv ads my game is so laggy,2
The game is good just there are a lot of adds so that's why i give 2 stars,2
"I'm fine with the ads. I just hate that the game has a mind of its own after you pass a few levels. No matter how fast i move those little blue people, they keep running in the opposite direction! Now i know nothing is wrong with my screen because I'm typing just fine right now. Y'all are just dishonest and runined my chances of having fun. I know I'm not the only one.",2
Fun game but unplayable due to adverts. Every single level that takes 25 secs to complete has a 1 min advert. Don't bother installing,2
Bad,2
Ok but far to many ads,2
Game its self is ok but omg the ads..eaxh level takes no more than 10 seconds to complete and theres an ad after every single one..ended up deleting pretty quickly sue to this.,2
Too many ads,2
"I understand you want to make money, I'll pay to remove ads, I know some won't. Between each level there's no need for ads. That's greed",2
The concept is good but they have Programmed the levels in a way where you can't finish the regular income levels over 200 troops. I've reached near the end with 300 troops but then some kind of trap or hole comes which puts my troops down to 150.,2
Fun but too many ads.,2
You have a game in your ads.,2
An ad every time your done with a level,2
Uninstalled because there were too many ads,2
Eh decent I guess,2
So many ads.,2
Ads every where after every game. The game takes less the a minute per round...,2
"Ads before, after, and during every level. Just a game to watch ads",2
The ads are way too frequent and interrupt play before you can even start liking the game.,2
You'll spend at least half your time in ads with this game,2
"Absolutely infested with ads, and the gameplay is not good enough to make up for this. Becomes very tedious and repetitive.",2
Unistalled it even though I enjoyed the game... just way too many ADS.,2
"The game concept is okay esp just for mindless entertainment, however you will get a ad after every run and each run only goes for about 10 seconds with a then 20 second ad. Not worth the time investment into this game.",2
Nikhil Gupta,2
Way to many adds. Dont get this game if you want to spend more than half of the time looking at adds,2
Good game,2
Becaouse i like the game,2
"Adverts after adverts. Watch one for a bonus, one before a game and one after. Also, the traps take up half the road so you can rarely get over 300 people to the finish.",2
Nice 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,2
Please remove Islamic flag,2
😭😭,2
I really like this game but there is literally an ad after every level and then more ads to upgrade anything. You watch more ads than game play. There isn't an option to pay a couple bucks to get add free either,2
Way too many ads. Game is enjoyable for the short time you can play it.,2
Notba game I enjoyed but that's not Down to the game itself,2
"Potential but as almost every other review has said, too many adverts against actual playing time, frustrating. 100m downloads, 100m deleted after a day also.",2
SO LAGGY! I couldn't even get past level one! Plus the game idea is cool but the lag ruins it. :\,2
10 seconds per level followed by 30 seconds of ads. Rinse & repeat... Removed game after 20mins.,2
"I don't mind the ads, after all, it's a free game. My low rating is due to the lack of challenging levels. There's even a build/battle section that you can easily beat and doesn't advance beyond the United States of America. I deleted the game after only a few days of playing.",2
😈😈😈😈😈,2
"Game is ok but they should rename it ""Watch the Ad"".",2
Fun game but the developer is greedy. You have to watch an ad after every single level which only last about 20 to 30 seconds. I understand the ads but for christ sake.,2
The game is not bad but they're way too many as that just kill the mood. After a few hours it's kind of pointless because all the levels are almost the same. I would like for the developer to do more work on it it's still a work in progress,2
After an hour or two of playing it almost doesn't matter what you do. The math is also super easy....very boring,2
Its poop,2
"The game is fun, but too many ads. I was watching ads for more time than actually playing.",2
"I do like the game but the last obstacles are really annoying. I could have built up a big group of people but the last obstacle always drops your final number to, on average, 120-185 so it makes me think sometimes, what's the point in getting loads of people when a load of them get wiped out and that is the whole point of the game",2
I t I tried to play but there are too many ads 😠. It's also boring it's also boring because you just move your finger.😐😭,2
Vs,2
"While the ads are a bit annoying, what is worse for me is that there's no real challenge. You can get tons of little characters, but you can't change their formation or anything. Just swipe left and right then hit the bigger amount. You can't avoid many of the obstacles which will take out a good chunk of your forces with little recovery.",2
Way too many ads after every game there's will be ads,2
"Game is fun and runs smooth ,but the ads after every level are a bit much.",2
Too many ads. Literally every 20 seconds,2
"Don't put ads after finishing a level. Literally made me uninstall it. Ads for bonuses is fine, but not during gameplay. 2 stars",2
DELET,2
Good,2
Got boring after a while,2
"TOO MANY ADS!!! Get rid of the ads after every single level. Please. Leave them to change your player color and to unlock a skin. That's more than enough. Also, pointless to not be able to move your group back or have them wait for an obstacle to clear. Why collect 500 guys to lose half of them on an obstacle you cannot avoid. This game was fun for an hour but the ads and the inability to control your group makes it very short-term.",2
Fps drops,2
Fun game but WAYYYYYY TOO MANY ADS,2
The levels are too short to justify an ad per level - the (not optional) ads should not take up more time than the game. Uninstalling.,2
Its a alright game but theres to much adverts like when i finish one level theres always a advert.,2
Good game but annoying ads after each level,2
Has potential but the amount of ads hinders your entertainment.,2
Its a dit hard ill edmit but still so cool,2
This is a beautiful game in the world.,2
Not a bad game but you spend more time watching ads than actually playing,2
Entertaining but too easy and too many ads.,2
TrevenLo,2
Fun game. But its heavy on the ads. So cuts down on the fun.,2
Too many ads,2
There are large groups of people without wearing masks,2
I only played this game because I saw it on an ad. The only problem is that there's always an ad after each level,2
Good gameplay but the ads don't feel balanced. 20 second gameplay loop to get slapped with a 30 second unskippable ad with zero incentive to actually watch it. Lazy and greedy developers is the best way to describe this gameplay loop,2
"Good game, but it's a freaking add trap",2
Love the conceptm but every action results in an ad playing. I'd glad pay for an ad free version,2
Fun enough but the ads are very intrusive,2
"It's a good game, but I just can't enjoy it with ads after every round... I understand that you need to make profit, but there's already an ad at the bottom the entire time.",2
Decent game but ads continually lock up my phone. Needs less ads and silent ads.,2
Too much adds,2
Constent ads after everything.,2
"Wow, that's a lot of ads!",2
"Far too easy, probably made for money from ads, don't bother",2
Would actually be a fun addictive game if it wasn't for having an advert after every single level and everything you do.,2
"Impossible to finish with 10x multiplier as game faces you to lose characters keeping you from passing 5.6x. On top of that, there is an ad after literally EVERY... SINGLE... LEVEL.",2
"Very commercial. Nice idea though. Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the constant ads. I do understand that it's their only income but an ad after every level! Come on! That's greedy! And sometimes it's the long ad that you cannot skip not the short one. You're missing the point, i've downloaded the game to play not to watch ads. Uninstalling it right now.",2
Toooooo many adds,2
Nice game,2
It's actually a good one but full of advertisements hate it,2
Adds,2
"This potential to be a fun game, but clearly this is nothing but an ad farm. I played for all of 10mins and in that time I cleared 6 levels and watched at least a dozen ads. Not worth it. Uninstalled.",2
Guy's,2
Boring. Placement of your finger to control the game makes it impossible to read the numbers that you need to know to make decisions.,2
Gr,2
Meh,2
It is a cute diversion but I would much rather buy it for a few bucks then suffer the inordinate advertising;,2
Game glitches to much,2
"Good game, just ashame how many adds are in it!",2
This game is great if you don't mind spending 3/4 if your time watching ads rather than actually playing the game,2
Good games but adds game,2
It's not capable for 80 MB It will be only 20 MB,2
Would be a good game. Only played about 10 levels then uninstalled. For every 10 second level there is a 15-30 second ad. That's every level!,2
Would be a great game if the majority of the time wasn't spent watching ads. 10 seconds of play time; 30 seconds of ads. See the problem?,2
Ad every level. At least let me choose if I want to watch ad for bonus.,2
Fun game but ads after each level. I'll be willing to pay for an ad free version.,2
Too many adverts,2
"Fun game to play, but it is 60% ads and 40% gameplay, i mean an ad after every game, the games are short as heck, do not download",2
Way Way too many ads,2
"When I have most numbers of people like - 180,250 and 320 I don't reach at highest number I reach only on X6.0 or in final battel my most people are die. Is that correct?. No. I doesn't like this. So that's I am giving only two starts.",2
Not bad but the tik tok ad just would not stop popping up. UNINSTALL! !!!,2
Too many ads,2
Very nice game,2
Game is simple & entertaining but there are WAY too many ads. You will also quickly run out of things to spend gems on making collecting them meaningless.,2
Would be fun if I didn't have an add every 20 seconds of playing,2
"Neat concept, but boring and not as advertised. I've just reached level 100 and have yet to be challenged. The mathematical decisions are only addition and multiplication, not division as shown in the ad. Plus losing people is inevitable. You can make all the right decisions, and still the obstacles will cut into your numbers, although you'll still win the level. Just seems lazy.",2
"Could be good...if it didnt glitch every time it was time to move. It was like my guy was on auto pilot, no control. I had no issues with ads. In fact, no ads came up until i chose to watch one for a new skin. But the glitching made it impossible to play. No option but to uninstall. And for the record, its not my internet thats the issue. No other games that I play freeze.",2
Too many ads to actually enjoy the game.,2
All levels are almost the same and it mecomes boring...,2
Fun for a second can't go any further After finishing America. Got old fast,2
Nice but boring,2
Fun game but there is an add after every level and levels are shorter than the add.,2
It is so laggy and there is way to many ads,2
Too many adverts.,2
Not worth the overabundance of ads after every level.,2
its laggy,2
Great fun.. Totally spoiled by advertisement after every game.,2
"Has potential & fun sounds, but like others have said: gems are irrelevant except for buying skins, tons of ads, & the conquer map stops after USA. The obstacles are randomly generated, meaning all are relatively easy, but if you happen to get one you didn't pass it generates a ""new level."" So you can't redo it. Occasionally you might get one that seems actually impossible. Can't go back to check. (I did over 200 levels hoping to unlock more countries to conquer 😮‍💨)",2
"Fun game, but you spend more time waiting for the ads than playing the game",2
"Fun game, absolutely. But do we need to have ads after every level? If I'm trying to listen to music or a book while playing it's aggravating to have to pause my media to get to the next level.",2
"A bit stuttery during play, characters jump from one side to the other so suddenly that you accidently wipe half of them out. Adverts last longer than the gameplay, levels do not get progressively harder or longer so it becomes boring after a while.",2
The ads are longer than the play time. Uninstalled.,2
"Too easy, not a challenge at all, and A LOT OF ads",2
There are alot of apps and I can't even have time to play the game I just hate it,2
How,2
A lot of disturbing ads,2
Great game but please make and ad free version. I'd so pay for it! Sooooooo. Many. Ads.,2
To many ads,2
meh,2
Fine,2
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤛🤜🤛🤜🤛🤜🤛🤜🤛🤜🤛👅👅👅👅👅,2
Too much ads,2
It's ok just a bit boring after a while,2
Rest all ads are fine. But why do you play an ad every time after the end of the level? Irritating.,2
"The game is simple as it gets. If you can't do simple math such as addition and multiplication, so easy a 5th grader will get bored of this. Which I don't mind some mindless running games (I mean remember temple run?) My BIGGEST annoyances with this game is after every run you play, which lasts literally 15-30 seconds, you'll receive an ad right afterwards that are almost a minute. Ads that last longer than what you play? No thank you folks.",2
"Not a bad game but when you spend more time watching adverts than you do playing, it leaves a sour taste.",2
"If you want to spend more time watching ads than playing the game, this is the game for you. The game itself isn't all that bad for what it is, it's just overrun by ads.",2
Too much ads.,2
"If don't like the ads, Just turn off your mobile data or wifi. HAHAHA",2
I don't think that I like it and it's not responding to me,2
Way too many ads to be remotely worthwhile.,2
30s ads every 10s,2
Great but please STOP HAVING SO MUCH ADS!!!,2
"I enjoyed the game, but there are too many ads! I have to play it offline to get rid of them. The game also lags when there's too many little people you obtained (like 150+). It just beats the whole purpose of the game. Play it for a couple of days, then got easily bored",2
"Boring, repetitive, too easy, and too many ads",2
"Meh. Gameplay is OK. Ads seemed to be a little better (not after *every single* level), but the 30 sec ads, too close together...? Not a fan. Not interested in Tony Robbins seminar. Free or not. 😳🙄",2
Would be fine bit an add after every level is too much,2
Ads after every single stage. Ads cannot be skipped.,2
Thanks Welcome,2
Really fun game but an advert after every level is too much. They're not short adverts either. Uninstalled.,2
It's just a game to waste time with. But having a small ad after every level gets old quick. Just have 1 ad after beating a boss or something and it will help more. Not worth spending any real money on. 2 stars,2
"Fun, but way too many ads! Makes it no fun.",2
"It was interesting in the beginning, but after ten levels it got boring. It doesn't help that you can buy every settlement all at once by watching ads. Made it feel really cheap and uninteresting. I wouldn't play again.",2
To many ads,2
lag,2
Buggy as all hell. Will just freeze mid game. Won't crash or lag. Just freeze.,2
Fun but there is an ad after every level,2
An add literally after each level. Really?,2
Too many ads,2
"It's a fun game, but the ads are ridiculous. Turn on airplane mode when you play and it's fun, otherwise it's just ad after ad.",2
Way to many adssss,2
"Like everyone else says, the ads are way too much, levels take about 10 seconds to complete, then you have a 30+ seconds ad to watch. 75% of your time on this app is being forced to watch full screen ads. Plus the game isn't all that fun or challenging, quick uninstall for me...",2
"I really liked the game but I had to delete it, way too many adds.",2
The game seems aight but the ads are ridiculous and way too frequent... so uninstalled it.,2
Is no maps,2
"Super fun, but to glitchy to olay.",2
Fun game. But dealing with an ad at the end of every level is a deal breaker. I would'nt mind one full ad every 5 levels.,2
"This game is perfect if you love watching ads. Play 10 seconds, watch an ad. The game play really isn't enough fun to even justify it. Uninstalled within 5 mimutes. Don't waste your time, unless of course you like wasting your time :)",2
This game is way too glitchy and has so many ads,2
Its good and I luv it But to many ads,2
Nthng interesting.Apart from the ads this is little boring.,2
Fun principal but you spend more time watching ads then playing.,2
"The game itself is addictive, adds dont bother me... but what is really annoying is that i have finished off the map but cant seem to actually complete zone 4... and are there more zones? Or is that it? Lots of diamonds accumulating and nothing to spend them on",2
"Good Lord the ads. You get offered freebies for watching them, you say no, and it still opens an ad. What's the point?",2
Glitches likec crazy,2
Ridiculous Ads ruined the game. More time watching ads than playing! Uninstalled,2
"Too many adverts The game idea is fun, but I've played 5 levels and the adverts are too much. After each level (which takes maybe 15 seconds to complete) there's an advert, which is longer than the level took to do. I've had enough of this already, so I'm uninstalling it.",2
"Its ok.. its one of them games ya play while taking a dump 🤷‍♂️.... then ya done. If you wanna avoid the ads put ya phone in aeroplane mode it stops all add for the sake of a dump. Besides that ya game is ok but its just a ""dumping time memory"" but atleast ya tried. Ill be sure to ask the dude in the stall beside me if he wants to try besides that cant complain. Congratulations on your dumby game. 💋",2
As interesting as these type of games can be but impossible obstacles limit game play and previously earned skins are offered multiple times.,2
"I can't buy Place in Build, I have many Brilliant, but when I click on place, it not work",2
Too many ads,2
Way to many adds,2
Too many adds. Very short levels with little content.,2
So many ads 😔,2
Its good,2
"Game was ok, however there are more adds than there is game time. I Uninstalled after one day because it was so annoying. Don't recommend",2
Nice,2
"the game is about how many units you can keep on the obstical course, but every time I achieve over 400 or so units the game crashes",2
"Way too many ads. It's a decently fun game, but there's an ad after every 8 second long level. I decided to Uninstall when an ad INTERRUPTED one of the 8 second long levels. Absurd. Not worth it",2
Fun for a bit then the excessive adverts grind you down and you uninstall.,2
"Far too many adverts, you simply cannot enjoy the game",2
Far too many adverts between every single level,2
Better than arrow fest. Still a waste of time and storage.,2
Game was fun but had terrible glitches. Couldn't even move my men left or right without it freaking out or not responding. Couldn't enjoy the game anymore.,2
Fun a challenging game,2
Could be better but not the worst either!,2
"Way to many ads. Every lvl you complete you get an ad. Would be a fun game, maybe ads every 3 or 4 lvls but not every lvl. This goes on my uninstall list.",2
This game is a great stop gap before total boredom,2
"I like the game, but there are to many ads. After every single game, there are ads. Not much point in playing a stage that is so short and getting loads of ads",2
Way too many adds😑.,2
"The actual game is OK, but every button press results in 20 seconds of ads. It's just too much and spoils the game as it's very jarring.",2
"To people that likes a game with ads after every level, then this is the perfect game",2
Adverts after every round 👎🏻,2
This game [BUY STUFF] just has [BUY STUFF] too many [BUY STUFF] ads to be [BUY STUFF] any fun [BUY STUFF] so I had [BUY STUFF] to uninstall it.,2
Too many ads and gets boring really fast,2
Game itself is good but each level lasts about 15 seconds and then you are forced to watch a 30 second video after each and every level. Ridiculous.,2
Mucha publicidad. Cada nivel dura como 10 segundos y toca ver una add the 30 segundos cada nivel.,2
Fun game. Ads are way too much.,2
Boring and too many adds,2
maths,2
"Didn't take long to build and unlock characters, now not playing it as there is nothing to buy or achieve",2
Good game. Too much ads. You watch more ads than the time it takes you to beat the level.,2
Cyj 2 .,2
"Game is fun, but gets extremely laggy, making it impossible to play. Also TONS of ads. Ads are longer than the actual levels",2
"The commands act in a retarded way, and it's a bit repetitive",2
too laggy,2
I wanted to try it... It takes 10 seconds to beat first levels and 30 to watch ad after every level... Not my cup of tea...,2
"Im currently downloading it by mobile data at countryside and its INFINITELY LONG. But anyways. I have seen ads of this game and it looks fun. But many users say that it has lots and LOTS of ads. I am 100% sure, that playing without wifi is the best for these kinda games, cuz u won t get any ads. U can just use it if u wanna unlock a thing in the game, just open ur wifi, close the game and open it again and it shoud refresh with the wifi. When ur ready u just close ur wifi, and do the same again",2
More Ads than actual gameplay! An advert after every round is just frustrating and will lose you a lot of users. You gotta have a balance.,2
Too many ads interrupting gameplay,2
It is bad ok please don't play are you play your phone is damaged. So don't play the game I begging you ok please don't play 😐😕😕😕😕😭😭😭😢😢😢😿,2
Too many long ads. Makes it very boring when the ad takes longer than a game,2
Would be more fun without the extreme amount or ads. Some you can skip and some even skipped forces you to see half of it. Rather go elsewhere to cure my boredom,2
It's ok I'll play it for a while I don't think I'll keep it,2
"The game is fun, but too many ads",2
ডথদঝণব,2
"The gameplay seems quite fun, but each stage lasts just moments and then there's an advert break. I timed it and I spent longer waiting for adverts than actually playing the game. Uninstalled after about 30 minutes",2
"IMPORTANT: Tried it and tired of it, IMMEDIATELY. EVEN WHEN YOU ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IN THE GAME, IT IS MANDATORY TO WATCH THEIR ASININE MINDLESS ADS OTHERWISE YOU LOSE WHAT YOU HAVE PLAYED FROM THE START! Need something extra? Watch an ad. Accomplished something that is NECESSARY to progress the game? You STILL watch their ads! You'll be exploited! If you value your time, don't play this bullcrap. If they are oh so desparate for the holy dollar, they could have just make the game a paid one.",2
"Fun game, but super glitchy, tons of ads.",2
"Fun, but you spend more time watching ads than playing. I played a few levels and then uninstalled.",2
"This game is more ads than actual game. Sure, mobile games need ads to help fund them, but this was ridiculous. I played for all of 15 minutes and at least 10 of those minutes were ads.",2
Its boring 😴 at first it's ok after that getting bored.,2
Too many commercials,2
Great game but too many add,2
So many ads,2
"Mainly serves as a money grab game, unfortunately. The game concept is great, and it can be expanded upon, but the game is super plagued with ads. You practically get an ad every attempt at a level and it gets super annoying. You can't even change your character color later on without watching an ad; and even so, you get a random color. They clearly want you to watch those ads.",2
"As others said, after each level an add, even the starting levels.",2
Ads after every mission.,2
"Too easy, too short, too many ads. Not enough to capture your attention for more than about 5 mins.",2
🕴️🗿🗿,2
It gets very boring after the first couple games. Nothing much changes.,2
Too many long ads that take 3 clicks to close.,2
"Game is fun but way to many adds, add a pay option for no adds...",2
Thus game was 'OK' but I have a number of problems. The amount of ads in this game do annoy me and the levels are SUPER short.,2
Soo many ads. Too many for me. Uninstalled.,2
"Essentially an ad platform. Would've been an alright brainless timekiller game on ps1 all those years ago, without the ad after each level, that is. Definitely 30 seconds of gameplay for 30 seconds of ad. Plus one star for a cop getting beat up by a crowd regularly.",2
To many ads!!!,2
It's fun but it has 👎 no challenge. Ads are bad and it's graphics 😒 are a little bit annoying 😑,2
"Good concept, but needs to be expanded a LOT more. Just playing on and off, I completed the entire thing in one day. The ads are also annoying and no way to remove them. If the levels got more complicated and there was a larger and more complicated side game then I'd recommend it.",2
"Too much Ads Ads to start, ads at the end of level, ads to unlock features, ads everywhere.",2
"It is very very glitchy on most levels. Also when it askes you if you would like to double the coins or dimons you get by watching an add, when i said no on multipul ocasions it still playes an add!😡 please could you fix this. I am giving it 2 stars because of the amount of adds (you cant even play) and that there is an add after evey level! PLEASE FIX!",2
Too many adds,2
Constant of advertisement (videos) and a lot of 30sec ones after each level or play you make...,2
"ADS, never ending ads. Buh bow.",2
Too many adds and the game is too slow,2
Could be fun...but holy ads Deleted,2
This is an easy game but ads are everywhere including in middle of gameplay plus you get bored fast.,2
Okayy not bad,2
"Not one of the worst, but definitely one of the weakest games I've played. Sometimes it slows down and says it isn't responding. Also, the boss levels are OK, but I get really, REALLY tired of playing the level every 3 stages.",2
Kept freezing during play uninstalled it,2
Poor game,2
Too many ads,2
The ads are gratuitous to the point of unplayability.,2
"For the people who are complaining about ads, if you are too stupid to turn off mobile data and wifi in this day and age, you are dumb. Beyond that, this game is way too easy to beat and buy everything, as well as lacking any substantial challenge along the way. The two stars isn't because of ads, it's for the actual game. Once you buy all the camp spots, gems are useless... that didn't take long. Game could be fun if there was added gate math challenges like subtraction and division.",2
It's a good game the ads are annoying but what bugs me is the game wasn't at my home screen and now I can't get to my other games,2
Civil war breaks out between the Red and Blue. No bullets used,2
Really? An ad after every single level? Good job on getting me to uninstall. 2 stars because at least it is what it says it is. Ad fest though.,2
Really eazy,2
Deleted after 2 round's because of adverts after each round so you know where this game is going...play..advert..play..advert..play..advert..no thanks..👋👋,2
Noob,2
Boring,2
"There is an ad every 20 seconds and every action you make you have to watch an ad, it would be alright if they scaled down the ads",2
Too many adds. An add between each level and since the game is fast two are a minute ugggg,2
Not bad not good 😑🌱,2
Too many ads. Game will be uninstalled.,2
Fun game but WAY too many ads.,2
It glitches alot so i dont like it but over all i think the game i cool.Joke\ what if the teacher says work on math u play this game be like😂😂😂the teacher😳. But yeah i like this game.,2
This game is cool 🤞😁,2
"I like the idea of this game, but it is so glitchy like dude. When I wanted to go to X3 it made me go to 30. Maybe it's just my internet but I doubt it. I don't really mind adds. But maybe there is a bug idk but uninstalled it maybe I will install it again if I see better reviews.",2
Don't make retards play the game for the ads make a player with over 10 brain cells do it!! IT DOESNT MAKE PEOPLE WANNA PLAY IT JUST P****S THEM OFF!!!!!,2
I don't like this store game is so boring 😌,2
Its a good app but issue about only this game were Be hanging so thats why...,2
good game in concept but there are just too many ads for it to be even slightly fun,2
It was not very fun as it seems I have only played it for 2mins and it makes your phone freeze I am not being mean but this is just constructive critism and I am nice so I gave u 2 stars,2
Too many ads and no levels of build beyond USA.,2
game is fun but the ads are awful. How many adverts can you fit in a game? literally every level there is an ad that you can't skip after first few levels. The concept is great but the game will die because of the adverts,2
"Nice idea, different kind of tower defense game but both graphics and the playability of the game ruins the joy of the game.",2
Too. Many. Flippin'. Ads.,2
Too many commercials!,2
"The ad is meant for baiting people to play the game, and there is way too many ads. Overall it's a quite fun and satisfying game, but it shoves ads down your throat, and the ad makes literally everyone have a bad next 5 minutes of their life.",2
Gets boring after 1 hour of gameplay. Too many ads,2
"If you love advertisements, then this advertis- I mean ""game"" is for you. This concept Piqued my interest, but its not a game first. It's just a commercial for other games with brief game sequenced in-between. In fact, I'm pretty sure you spend more time being forced to watch ads then actually playing the game. Would not recommend.",2
Always freezes up when you're above 180-200+,2
"It's a fun game to play, but getting a 30 second add after every single level makes this an ad watching app rather than a game. The levels are shorter than the ads...",2
It got kind of fun at the start until how long the ads are and there is way to many,2
Too many adverts.,2
EXCELLENT,2
"Interesting fun concept, but WAY too many ads. Pass.",2
I don't think I would really consider this a game. There is no challenge in it. Pretty boring.,2
this freaking Game 🎮🎮🎮 is childish,2
Note bad but note very good,2
Great game but I have a major issue. Ads.,2
"Ads literally every single level. Not worth trying to play, but the concept is fun",2
Good game,2
Way way 2 many ads. What r they thinking,2
"Jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjuuuuuurtrrr 📻🎤🎵🎵🔔🥁🎷📯🎻🎺🙄😑😐🤔bb1""""7@4. Boo-boo boo-boo the",2
Really nice game just way to much ads the ads is killing the game,2
Way to many ads!!!! Makes it hard to even play the game.,2
The game is fun but there are so. many. ads. I spent more time watching ads than actually playing. So I uninstalled it. ☹️,2
Great game but far to many adverts for my liking so uninstalled . There's nothing worse than an advert after every single level.,2
Interesting concept for a game but the incessant ads ruin it.,2
An add after each 30 second level made me delete it. too annoying!,2
Great arcade game but you spend more time trying to get out of ads to play again. If you play then immediately close the app and open it back up you can avoid ads entirely and it becomes a 5 star arcade game :p,2
"I understand you have to make money, but this is just too many ads for the amount of gameplay. I only played a couple of levels, but the ads were taking longer than actual levels.",2
Fjfkfbc jsjsje hsj hsj oxidises leisure I'd h rickshaws jsjsje dispirited,2
Game is good but too many adds Which are very annoying,2
"The game is nice, but at the end of every phase you have to watch an ad. It's an excessive amount of ads.",2
Too many ads,2
After every game a 30 sec commercial,2
"Fun game, but seriously!? I played for a few seconds and was met with an ad. Every few seconds of play is then met with an ad. I just can't.",2
"Interesting game, but the number of ads is awful",2
"It would be fun, even with the extreme amount of ads, but the ads the developers use are very intrusive. I uninstalled after it kept opening the play store when I tried to close the ads.",2
Concept is good. But for every 5 second round you watch a 20sec ad.,2
"Fun, but way too many ads. I could've taken an ad every ten levels or even every five, but one after every level is too much! I'm uninstalling.",2
Entertaining game but long ads after every level.,2
Watched more ads than actually played the game. There is literally an ad after each and every level,2
Good game for kids or adults who need to learn basic mathematics,2
More ads than gameplay,2
"Too many ads, and performance issues.",2
"Likeable game, would like to endure more level 's, see how to improve my techniques in the game. Very interested to get involved and have a go at this game as soon as possible. Excited .",2
"It's okay, nothing special",2
"Fun concept, just too many ads to be playable. Uninstalled 🤷🏼",2
Ads after every game! So ANNOYING!,2
Too many long adverts. Nice little game if it wasn't for sooooo many ads.,2
Great game. Unless you count the ads,2
Too many commercials,2
It makes my phone slow when I have a lot of people,2
Game is a lot of fun but there is a one minute ad after every level (which only take 10 seconds to do). I'd happily buy an ad free version if they offered one.,2
"This game, as a puzzle, is outsandingly fun to me. But, it's the most shameful and blatant money grab I've ever seen. I've played for 30 minutes, and in reality, I've only played for 10, because ads take 2/3 of the time. Would rate a 5 star if the ads were a reasonable amount. Not playing this game, because I don't want to feed shameful money hungry people. If you are so desperate for money go work at your local McDonald's.",2
More ads then game,2
"Great game but spoiled by adverts, uninstalled due to this..",2
Timepass game.,2
to many adds and why put stiars if when uadd more cherecters there's not enough bc the adding is to low,2
This game 🎞🎞🎞👻,2
I am severely disappointed because every time I get over 300 little men thingys the game gets all glitchy and causes me to loose most of them .....fix this obserdity ‼️‼️‼️‼️😠😠,2
"SOOOOO many ads. Quick, simple levels means you end up spending more time waiting out ads than actually playing the game. Also, in game ads for upgrades stopped working within the first 5-10 levels",2
"The game is actually quite fun, but the sheer number of 30 second ads is absurd. 1 between every level. 1 to level up. 1 or 2 to open a chest. 1 to get back to the game. Play for 8 seconds. 30 seconds ad. Sorry guys. Not an even exchange.",2
Invasive ads but it's payable on airplane mode.,2
Too many ads,2
"Not a bad idea for a game, but far too easy and a serious advert generator. Ads between every level that take numerous clicks to skip. Get the opinion the ads were more important to the developers than the game.",2
More time spent in commercials than play time,2
"Mindless entertainment, which is reasonably fun. Problem is that you can do virtually nothing without ads. It's very clear that this is nothing more than a vehicle for showing ads rather than a real game.",2
Laggy,2
Overdone on the ads,2
"1. Ads - levels take 15 seconds, but a 30 second ad afterwards 2. Game has frozen a couple times",2
Good game...enjoying the challenge. Must know how to do mathematics.,2
Too much ads. Game would be nice with much less ads,2
Good fun when it works but glitches for the videos and diamonds are useless after island all built. Can't trade for money or invest in starts or income level (or whatever it is),2
30% gaming 70% adverts. I understand if its a free game youve got to expect adverts but this is ridiculous. A 15-20 second level will required 30-40 second advert.,2
Will Freeze and crash often.,2
The game may be fun but the experience is completely ruined by too many commercial breaks. What could have been a fun fast game gets its legs sawn off by greediness. A tale we saw already too many times.,2
"Entertaining game play, but not entertaining enough to be worth 20 seconds of ads for every 10 seconds of play...",2
Had to delete as the adverts last longer than the levels! So annoying!,2
I give two star because of Ads Good Game but Ads disturb too much more fun without Ads or less Ads.,2
The ads make the game unplayable,2
Too many ads,2
Op,2
The company,2
made my laptop slow,2
"Loved the game. Lost all progress when I moved to a new phone. Can't find any way of backing up games, or moving game data over.",2
"So many ads, fun game behind that though",2
"Things are fun: fresh graphics, many colors to use, easy to complete Things are horrible: boss is not getting stronger, crashing if with too many stickmen, small jump slops, bad designs",2
So... Many... Ads 🤑🤑🤑,2
It's fun and relaxing - which is why I gave it 2 stars cause I didn't have the heart to do one - but an ad after EVERY level is a bit tedious even for a free app.,2
Gameplay is okish but with an ad after every 5 second level it became unbearable quickly,2
"Well, done everything in the space of a day, built all buildings on the island and beat all 4 areas in attack mode. So erm, now what, nothing else to do. Kinda disappointed as did enjoy it. Oh well onto next time killer game.",2
"this game is okay but too much ads, everytime you success the level you need to watch 30 second long ads without skipping it",2
"What everyone else said. The game is a great way to pass the time, and the controls are simple. Way too many ads. I'd be OK with an ad every two or three levels, but the ads are longer than the levels.",2
"Too much ads, it is unreal to play",2

"Fun game, awful play to ad ratio. Unplayable",2
"Okay concept, terrible controls and too many long ads",2
"It was decent, the ads aren't worth it.",2
Count.Masters.Stickman.Clash,2
Too many ads,2
"The game seems pretty cool but omg advert after each level is insane, uninstalling after 5 mins of play, just way too much advertising",2
Great game but WHAT THE LAG??!! EVERY SINGLE TIME I LOAD UP A LEVEL IT LAGS LIKE HECK!! FIX THE BUG MAN!!!!!,2
"Way way way too many ads. And they are all either 30 second ads, or the ones you have to click 2 or 3 or even 4 times to get rid of. Your seriously sirens more time in ads than you do playing the game.",2
Very repetitive. After you do 5 or so runs and fill out the US map nothing changes. Never figured out the purpose of the gems,2
"Fun, interesting but far too many ads",2
"Do you like ads? Oh boy, you betcha - everyone loves ads and have these developers got a treat for you? For just one or two minutes of game time you too (YES YOU!) can enjoy an unbridled ad-filled smorgasbord of the same clutch of ads. The game that accompanies the ads might be ok but due to the ads its almost impossible to tell.",2
"Was fine in the beginning , but i dont see the point in getting diamonds if you cant spend it",2
🚫,2
Game is fun enough but there's literally a 15-20 sec ad after every level.,2
Too much ads,2
"Fun, but to many ads.",2
"Fun game, way to many ads. Uninstalled.",2
The game part is fun but you spend more time watching ads than actual play time. Way too quick to complete the build part of the game so nothing to work towards - Needs expansion. Why give out diamonds when there's nothing to spend them on? Levels don't really get progressively harder so nothing to keep you playing.,2
Too many adverts. Omg. After each play two ads. Jusy too much.,2
"Ads. Ads, and more ads. After every level, ads. Too much. Ruins the experience.",2
"Rd nnjw,ll knmonno. . ) B nknkkk ma. Bb",2
Too many ads.,2
"This game will test your patience, every click and step there is an advertisements and for me it's really disturbing because you just want to play the game nicely and smoothly but EVERYTIME!! you click something or like you want to proceed to the next level it has always an advertisements. Please reduce these advertisements so that the players would play the game peacefully.",2
After each round there is a 15-20 second marketing. Uninstalled.,2
Far too many ads. There are ads after every run,2
To much adds,2
Gets boring after a little bit.,2
"Adds at this game are a joke, they last longer each time than the actual game. The game is very simple,but kinda good and entertaining. Imo adds make this app useless.",2
This is a good game but!!!!!🤬🤬🤬it has too many adds like after each level you have to watch a add!!!!!!f... This game,2
"The game is actually really fun, but it's very short. Unfortunately, you end up watching more ads than playing the game; at first you don't notice it, but after a while it gets irritating. Fun, but not worth it.",2
"The game was so laggy, I would lose way to often because of it. They're are way to many ads, and I would also sometimes lose, to the adds that pop up at the bottom. The only reason a gave it a two star, was because of the build and attack mode.",2
I built the whole island and now its boring. Their needs to be more island to buld.,2
I cant even play the game 3/4 of the time is just ads,2
To many damn ads,2
"Interesting concept but an advert after every level? Too many for me, uninstalled.",2
"I have reached with 250+ people, even 700+ people. But after crossing all obstacles, it abdruptly reduce the crowd to 196 without any obstacles. Only 6.2 is reachable Giving too much diamond. But completely waste. Only needed is gold and can't convert. 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7.0 is completely imagination and not allowed",2
"Boring, levels are too easy.",2
Fun idea but ad to play ratio is too high resulting in more time watching ads than playing the game,2
"Good quick game but too many ads, actually uninstalled because of the ads and you have to sit there and watch them as can't bypass them, which is a shame as it's a fun easy game",2
"Very laggy, and slow to load.",2
"The game is fun, its just the ads. I've already seen like 10 ads and its so frickin' annoying.",2
Nice adds. Interesting idea of more adds. Good physics of adds. Good quality of adds. First star for closing add feature. It really makes this game more interesting because you can watch more adds. Second star is for smooth and nice unistalation process. I can't wait to next version.,2
"The ads - too many for me. After every single run? Also, when I was playing, the game just suddenly stopped. Well, the people stopped walking, but their feet were moving?? Wouldn't really recommend. I get that games need ads to get money, especially if it's for free but still.",2
Waaaay too many adds,2
"I liked the game but there were constantly adds after every round. So, I guess it was ok. 😐",2
It's a fun game however the higher level I got the more it started to glitch out a time. It got to the place where I'd start loosing the little people because of the glitch. Then when they would attack the boss they'ed surround it but nothing would happen. The game needs some work.,2
"Kinda fun, but goes into other portions of play with no explanation and the ads are CONSTANT. The ads are also longer than the game segments so you spend more time watching ads than playing. Uninstalling.",2
There are way too many ads. You get a ad after every level. All these add ruin the experience Apart from the ads. It's a simple and fun game,2
It gets really laggy and there's bare adds,2
"Too many adds, adds, would be great without so many adds.",2
"The games is really good its just there are ads for everything you do, press one thing there's and ad, finish a level there's an ad it's just annoying",2
Count Masters: Crowd Runners,2
Nice game but too many ads,2
"Game sux. Frequent freezing and needing to force stop. When going from side to side, movement is ultra fast.",2
"Needs serious game development. Costumes are the same. The math is very basic, the bosses are very easy to beat. The prize is always 300 coins. Once youve played it once, it doesnt get any better at all.",2
More add time then play time,2
U don't have no control so it's no really a good game,2
It has potential but the random obstacles that kills have your team and there's nothing you can do ruin it for me.,2
Awesome game WAY TOO MANY ADS!! 😕,2
Too many ads,2
Ikii,2
Too many adverts,2
The actual game is fun but it only lasts a few seconds then you need to watch a add to go onto the next level far far to many adds for such short games. Pity as it has possibly to be a really good game.,2
"there is an ad after every single level, uninstalled after the first 4",2
App didn't exist when i tab tha back ...it didn't respond...!!!,2
This game keeps lagging if there wasn't so much lagging I think it would be a great game.,2
"More ads (usually for vulgar or disturbing games) than game. Literally. Otherwise would be very enjoyable. You just use your finger to slide the guy/army side to side as the ground advances, running through banners that add guys to the army and obstacles that remove them, do battle with other waiting armies, and sometimes a Boss at the end. But always an ad before starting a level, before retrying a level, after winning a level, after pausing then returning to a level.",2
You play for 15 seconds then have a 30 second add. Repeat. Fun and easy but more ad time then game,2
"Extremely commercial meme of a game that will likely die in a week. Was probably made in that same time frame. Am I laughing uncontrollably at the stupidity of it as I lose the few shreds of sanity I have left? Absolutely. Does it have a mutated AMOGUS? Hell yeah it does. I've named him Steven. How many ads are there? More than you could ever imagine. Dear God there's so many. In conclusion, terrible piece of digital avante garde shitposting. I shall enjoy this for 15 minutes before deleting.",2
"Ads with game play in between. About 15 seconds of game play, ads for 30 seconds afterwards.",2
Ad spam.,2
It's alright but I've noticed something. On average I get 110 people over the finish line. Usually the game lags to the point where the frames are so slow that it doesn't register you moving your finger fast enough to get past obstacles. That and the fact that the obstacles have been deliberately placed and created to make you have a certain amount of people reaching the end. It's an alright game but the fact that the pathway and obstacles are only wide enough for a at most 100 people. Not 250,2
It wasn't great. Ads strait out of the gate and no way to get rid of them. Every level has an add after it. On top of which about four levels in and even doning the right thing causes you to lose guys if your circle is too big,2
To many adds,2
This game is really buggy and randomly freezes.,2
Too many ads,2
To meny ads,2
e1 God,2
too much ads. so annoyed,2
"Fun game but too many ads, even when given the option to watch an ad to unlock something and then declining it still makes you watch an ad, uninstalling as the ads just take up too much time and make the game not as enjoyable, it's literally every level (30-45 seconds ) Others in the reviews say to turn off internet or go on airplane mode to remove adverts which is a possibility but you shouldn't have to do that to enjoy a game.",2
No skill involved. Some obstacles are impossible to pass with all your men so makes picking more up pointless. No matter how many you collect you can only finish the level with as many as will fit past the obstacles.,2
Would be 4-5 star if there was a way to pay for or play up levels to get rid of ads. The ads ruin it.,2
Well it's what it says it is. But it is another one of those games you will want to switch off your wifi to play. If not you just spend more time with ad's than actually playing the game.,2
"Too many ads. Sometimes even 2 ads in a row, each 30 seconds long and you can't skip them if you want to play next level. I deleted this game after 10 minutes.",2
"Overflowing with ads, unplayable.",2
WAY too many ads!!,2
A few levels then supposed to build some island,2
Too many adverts!,2
This is the first time I've seen an ad for a game that wasn't blatantly fake. It's looked fun so I decided to try it. I like the game but the ads are so intrusive that it's unplayable.,2
Fun game but there are soooooo many long ads. Pretty much after every level there's a 15 second ad you can't skip through and it really just kills the whole game,2
Welcone to ad city,2
Very slowly,2
"Its a good game,but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to many adverts! More time watching than playing! Puts you off, real shame :(",2
The overall game is fun but there are so many ads its annoying and hard to play.,2
"I like the idea for the game but all the levels are so easy theres really no challenge to be had. Plus the ads are awful, each level is followed by an ad twice as long as the level was",2
"It's a dumb, fun, easy game. Be ware though, it's like 95% ads and 5% actual game play",2
Good game but the adverts after every challenge got frustrating so I've had to uninstall the game.,2
Did not like it,2
"No technical issues. Gameplay is very rudimentary - in many cases the choice to be made is ""+5"" vs ""+20"", so it's not exactly challenging. Ads are long.",2
This game is good but so many ads . If you will make ads less then i will give it 5 star,2
"Ads-dictive! It's so many ads I wish I could just purchase it. Really kills the mood but I I understand. Gotta get paid, but at what cost 🧐",2
Fun game but way too many adds and within a few rounds of the game it started to cause issues and crashes in my phone. Stopped the moment I uninstalled the game,2
To many adds.,2
Not good there are many ads and many videos to watch that's why i am delete the game,2
"This is actually a series of ads, sometimes interrupted by a game.",2
Too many Ads...,2
Gameplay is ok- ruined by excessive ads.,2
"Fun little game, but so many ads made it unbearable.",2
This game made me feel sick. Good to know im the master of counting,2
"Overall a good game,my one problem with it though is that when i clicked on an ad to get extra diamonds,the ad took me to the app store. And when I came back to the game to collect the diamonds,it just restarted the game and didn't give me the diamonds that I watched the ad for. This is a really sucky move on the game developers part and I hope you have it in you to fix it.",2
Too many ads!,2
Love games 🎮,2
చెట్టల్లో యాప్,2
"Want something? Watch an advert... Don't want it? Here, have an advert anyway... Succeed? Ad to reward you.. Fail? Yet another Ad... Theres more adverts than content in this game.",2
Cool game but is very easy and there is an ad after every level so you get really bored fast.,2
I only got a few levels in before the game controls began glitching out. It was fun when it worked but it wasn't often.,2
"One commercial after another, no thanks.",2
Too many ads. Very repetitive and too easy,2
Sooo manyyyu addsss,2
Decent game although absolutely flooded with ads,2
Good game but has an idiotic number of ads. 1 round takes 5 second while there's a compulsory to watch ad after each round that lasts from 15-30 sec. You have a literally 1:3 ratio in gameplay:watching ads.,2
"Cool game ,,,too much ads",2
"Cute little game, but what do I do with gems?",2
It'd be fun if it was executed correctly. It isn't. If you didn't just randomly lose soldiers because the ramp isn't big enough... But it is kinda fun.,2
Its all good but when i gather 150+ people my game lag all the time,2
This game teach you how to win a war,2
Əдемі,2
Too many ads.,2
"Way too much ads. Had to delete it. My daughter liked the game itself, so do I. But everything time you finish a course an ad starts.",2
Its a copy-paste premise and very unoriginal. Just qnother recycled idea.,2
Way too many ads,2
"I think there may be a game in-between the ads. The game itself is super fun, but the amount of ads is unbearable. Deinstalled after a few rounds.",2
Fun game.. waaayyy too many ads,2
"The ads kill this game. It's fun but there is an ad all the time after everything. Really annoying, uninstalled.",2
This game could be fun but has way too many adds,2
Okay,2
Way too many ads!,2
You cannot control the crowd sometimes and the game doesn't allow you to win.,2
The game crazhed the third time I opened it and completely broke my phone. The screen went black and I couldn't restart my phone.,2
"Ad between every level. When levels take 5 seconds and ads run 30sec, is it normal to spend that much more time on ads than on the game??? Ads also have sound, not ideal when listening to anything while playing",2
"The game itself it alright, and can get you hooked. But the app was made to show you ads, and not for you to enjoy, which it pretty clear if you try it out..",2
It is an average mobile game,2
"I had this game only for 10 minutes as the advertisements made it impossible to enjoy. I'm sorry for this, as it could be a great game...",2
TOO many adds...,2
More ads than gameplay. Became boring very quickly.,2
Ads after EACH round take the fun away. Should be enough with the ad banner at bottom. And do cutscene ads to get skins or other rewards like some games I actually purchased. Real fun game though.,2
",💔💔💔",2
ಬಾಳು ಬಾಬು ಪವಾರ,2
"Lasted about 5 minutes with this....no instructions as to what the aim is, still haven't figured out wether less at the end or more is the goal....",2
Could be a fun game but too many ads. 30 seconds of advertising for every level (10 second level). ABSOLUTE JOKE! Uninstalled,2
"Fun game, but there are too many ads an you don't have the ability to skip them. What do you do with the diamonds? What's with the island level?",2
Too many ads,2
Okay the game is interesting....but there are way too much ads I can't even enjoy the game,2
Actually quite fun but you'll spend about 60-70% of your time watching ads vs. Playing the game.,2
Mothor game,2
There are so many ads in this game and I think they made the levels really short just so they could cram more ads in,2
"I like this game, but waaaaay too many ads and no option to pay for ad-free. Takes too much time and most of the fun away.",2
It is quite fun at the beginning but as the game goes on it becomes very boring,2
I couldn't tell if I was playing a game or watching ads,2
"fun to play, but it keeps crashing after the first level. would rate it 4 or 5 stars if it didnt crash.",2
Far too many ads - the idea of the game is good but the levels are short and there's ads after everyone. Literally spent more time watching ads than playing the game,2
"Could be a great game, gates need better sums, to make you think on your feet, airplane mode is a must. Gets repetitive real quick. Uninstalled.",2
Jts rly fun but whenever you do well it seems to start glitching having well over 200 at the fight the boss part of each level seems to be the tipping point which sucks bc it alreafy isnt so smooth with controlling the motors so when you try to get a handle on that the game just totally freezes and wont show your point for that,2
Md Moazzam,2
Liked the game but having to watch so many videos got too frustrating within a day. Ditched.,2
"Too easy to play, too much ads",2
Too many ads.,2
"There's an ad sheet every level. Each level lasts less than thirty seconds. So, really, you're watching ads and playing the game between ads. No thanks.",2
Its fun at first and challenging but the ads pop up every time you finish a round which only last 20-30 secs so your seeing ads more than your enjoying yourself,2
"Eh, its ok.",2
It's a good game but 2 stars because there are WAY to many ads and also it's kind of laggy and kind of boring,2
Too many 30 second adverts,2
Seems a good game. But far too many ads. The amount of ads caused me to uninstall in about 5 mind. About 50% of play time is watching ad (seriously),2
"Was a bit different than advertised, additionally the ads are insane. You'll spend more time watching ads than playing the game.",2
"Good game, more adverts than gameplay tho",2
"This app is boring it's always lagging and never stops playing adds and is very boring,it's to easy and it's boring please fix.",2
Looks fun,2
For every level you need to watch a advertise so I deleted it after 5 minutes.,2
Too many ads,2
Bad Very bad,2
This game has more performance issues than my 12 year old toaster,2
There's an ad after literally every level. Annoyed me to the point where I uninstalled the game after level 9,2
"No real point to the game. There are gems you can acquire, but haven't found a way to spend them. The levels don't ever get more difficult. There's a build mode that's interesting I guess (oh just remembered that's where you spend gems). But once it's built out, there's no more (hence me trying to figure out how to spend gems). And after you capture all the states, you play for nothing. It's okay if you need a mind numbing experience. Turn off wifi and data if you don't want to see the ads.",2
😴,2
10 seconds of game play per 30 seconds of advertising. I'm too busy watching ads to figure out the different aspects of the game.,2
"Ads are very aggressive. I also noticed apps i never wanted were being downloaded to my device after installing. The game is fun at first, but too easy and alot of the levels seems the same with only slight variations. I would have kept the game, but honestly the ads just killed it for me. I am fine with ads as an optional prize mechanic, but having non-skippable ads at the end of each level is inexcusable.",2
It's kinda dumb tbh,2
It's OK game.. just way too many ads.,2
"It has okay presentation and it passed the time for a little. After using my magic powers to whisk away the ads, it took me only a few hours to unlock everything and see all the game had to show me. After that point, it's just dull.",2
😊,2
Too many ads!!!!,2
"I liked the game play, but to many ads",2
Didn't enjoy so u installed.,2
There is so many ads it unbelievable 🙄 its sort of entertaining but there are better games out there.,2
Way. Too. Many. Ads.,2
Not much to the imagination,2
Too many ads.,2
Freezes up,2
Gives you ads after every level,2
Way too many ads!,2
To many as. One level = 1 ad,2
Downloaded app. Spent half an hour playing it. Most of the time just adverts.,2
It's a game that is interesting but the interest will not last long.. Very soon its repeatable and nothing excitement left..,2
👌👌,2
It's a fun game right up until the point where you getting ad every 5 seconds. Then it is just ridiculous.,2
Daming Ads,2
I dont know there are bad reviews about this game but I want to try it once,2
"An interesting concept (quick mental maths being gameified) but quite glitchily executed and just far too rammed full of incredibly intrusive ads. Almost every element of the game is ""watch-ads to win"" which is really just well beyond what I'd consider reasonable.",2
Nice idea but a total ad infestation,2
really glitchy,2
Mm good but boring,2
Very much adds,2
"Ridiculous amount of ads.. play a 10 second level, watch an ad. Go to home page, watch an ad. Click to begin building, watch an ad.. finish building, load ship, watch an ad.. played for 20 mins, must have watched 20 ads. Got fed up with it and uninstalled. Shame, was quite a good game, hence 2 stars, not 1",2
Good,2
Too much ads,2
Way to many ads!!!,2
"Game constantly crashes and there is incessant slowness/glitchiness. Then there are the constant ads. Yes, they are generally only 5 seconds, but it's like 5-10 secs of play followed by ads.",2
I understand the need for ads but they are far too often and far too long! I played 4-5 rounds and then deleted,2
"Just okay, but tons of ads",2
Could be good but forced ads are unbearable,2
"Gameplay is nice, but there is way too many ads. Every level is about 30sec long, and then you will be presented with a 1min unskippable ad almost every times.",2
6 ads in 5 minutes. Many of the ads resist being closed when its had its runtime. Very gimmicky,2
Kind of fun to play but way too many ads. After every single play period I had to sit through another ad and I just don't have the attention span for that,2
A play once and never again game. Each round lasts less than 10 seconds and unless you disable wifi and data while you play you'll get a 30 second ad in between each round. Do not recommend for more than 5/10 minutes of play.,2
Game sucks. Too many ads,2
It was ok,2
10 seconds of gameplay. 30 seconds of ads. every - single - round.... TONE DOWN THE ADS.,2
Liked the gameplay but uninstalled immediately. Not watching a 30 second advert after every level. Watching ads longer than playing the actual game,2
While I was playing the game I started lagging and glitching and when I opened a chest my whole screen just went greenish black I couldn't see and I couldn't play the game anymore so I'd rate it a 5 but there's to many bugs and glitchs! So please fix this,2
"WAY too many ads. I can't believe how many ads there are. I had to delete it! Don't get this game unless you enjoy watching ads more than you like playing the game. It's a great game of there were much less ads. Everytime I click on something new to do in the game, an ad comes on.",2
Low score due to ad after every level,2
Too many ads,2
Good at first,2
Buggy as all get out! Too many ads and some ads lockup your phone. It has the potential to be a lot of fun sadly.,1
If it weren't for the ads it could be fun,1
Very worst game in my life Oru level ku edail 30 second ad very worst game worst game,1
this game keep on freezing when Im in the middle of playing 😡😤,1
The number of ads on this game is a joke i uninstalled after 3 rounds cause i couldnt be bothered with them all. Boring 🥱,1
Really simple and easy,1
An add between every level,1
Too much adds between levels.,1
I hate this game only ads and ads,1
Op bhai.but grafix is very badxyz etc,1
To many ads really easy to win,1
Horrible game you have to watch a 30 second ad after every level. UNINSTALED after 5 minutes of playing.,1
It's ad after ad after ad. Could be an actually fun game if it didn't have so many ads.,1
Bahut hi bekaar app hai isme game ka enjoy to bahut hi jyada kam aur ad bahut hi jyada hai jiski bjah se pta hi nhi chalta hai ki game khel rhe hai ya ad ad khel rhe hai bilkul bakwas app hai koi download naa kare bus time aur internet khatam karna hai ad ki bajah se game ka enjoy to hai hi nhi har cheez ke baad ad hai bilkul hi bakwas hai ye,1
"There's an ad after each level. Levels take 10 seconds to beat, then 10 seconds of ads...",1
To many ads this is what I hate about games why are there so many ads.-.,1
A do nothing app. You can actually start the level then do nothing and you will still beat the level...and adds after every lvl,1
Sucked,1
It's nice all,1
Horrible. This game sucks,1
Bulok sa isang game lang 3 add lumalabas nd nkakaenjoy potangina nyo nkakahighblood maganda sana add lagi lumalabas,1
It is not to bad try it,1
Too many ads,1
"Could be fun, but too many long as interruptions.",1
I had this app for 5 minutes and spent more time watching adds than playing the game. There was an add after ever 10 second game.,1
Bad,1
"this game is bad, waste of time",1
Ad after every level,1
"Its not even a game, its an ad.",1
This game is ugly and so weak👎👎👎👎🤢🤢🤢🤢,1
Boring I was having 2000 points,1
"Could have been a fun game but there's an ad after every single run, with each run only lasting 10-15 seconds it becomes very annoying..",1
"So first of all, the constant barbarment of ads. I had to turn off my wifi in order to play. There are the upgrades, skin, and etc that sometimes requires you to watch an ad. Second of all, the boring gameplay. The levels are repetive obstacles. The game was made for a baby, which meant it had no challage at all. And the ads they create are stupid and yet, it still follows the same gameplay. For short, this game is boring, ad barbarment, and looks like it was made for an gnat.",1
Too many add that can't be skipped. I would gladly pay for a add free version but there is not option for this.,1
Too many ads,1
ADS,1
Too many ads,1
Just a advert sender. Level then advert. Not worth your time. Levels shorter than the ads,1
I hate it that is all in real life I want to give 0 stars,1
This game is literally 80% ads and 20% game play. Do not download,1
Too many adds,1
Way too many ads. Stupid game.,1
H zzz sex x;okkkkkkkkkkookkkkk,1
Trash add at end of every round,1
I can't skin the ads ITS SO ANOYING,1
Asking for personal data,1
Ads,1
Constant ads,1
worst experience ads pop up aleverytime,1
Nothing but adds,1
Wow the ads is very annoying,1
Adverts are too intrusive. I spend more time watching adverts than playing,1
Very bad too many ads ...,1
So many freaking adds. Every level an add. If I wanted to watch adds I would watch tv. I want to play a game without adds is that seriously to hard.,1
"Horrible, ads after every level and horribly boring.. dont waste your time with this one",1
Sooo many ads😔😑😐,1
This game is trash you never lose unless you want to,1
Hey enjoy this 10 seconds of gameplay now watch a 30 second ad. Also were gonna have ads during gameplay. Shameless.,1
Too many ads and not enough content.,1
Way too many ads. Basically shovelware,1
"Ad watching simulator. If i wanted to be bombarded with ads, I'd play a game that was actually fun.",1
Ads playing without pressing the ad button. Not challenging at all. Pointless.,1
I hate this game this is really bad thing Please please please don't download it. .,1
Ads after every level,1
Too TOO many ads.,1
"Fun game play. However, there are forced ads after each level, which would be fine if levels were longer and more challenging. But levels are super short, >30 seconds long, which makes it sure annoying for them to be followed by 20-30 second ads. 10/10 total time waster.",1
Bad,1
Too many ads! Imposible to play!,1
Too many ads,1
Too much add,1
10 seconds game with 30 seconds ad. Uninstalled.,1
IT CRASHED MY OTHER PHONE Others might say that there's ads on there but for me IT CRASHED! DO NOT GET THIS GAME🤮🤮,1
Awful. Inescapable ads. Waste of time.,1
"The time for Watching ads more than the time you play, so bad thinking for gain money!",1
Donkey,1
Gandi game he,1
Too many ad,1
How did this game get to second place video game out of so many things? You play for like 20 seconds and you get adds for like 40 second. Sometimes when you try to cancel the add you get tricked and it brings you to their adds page anyways.,1
"Way to many ads, after each level you get one. I am surprised I didn't have to watch one while writing this. Other wise it could be cool. GREED ruined this game, much like other things in our lives",1
Way to many ads!! I've never left a reveiw ever on a game ever but felt a need to warn other cause it ruined the game.,1
Just ads,1
"The ads didn't really bother me but this game is incredibly boring. It's clear after a few levels there is very little actual game play, all you do is slide your finger left or right. Don't waste your time",1
The game only exists to make you watch ads...,1
Very poor,1
More ads than game,1
2 seconds of unchallenging play wins you a 30 second forced ad. Yay!,1
Most boring game full of ad that slow down the enjoyment of the actual game. You spend more time watching ahite adverts DONT Waste your time installing this game.,1
the add is يقهر,1
Too many ads it's pethatic,1
"Incredibly boring. It's actually more easy to win each level than it is to lose, so the game gets old quickly. Plus so many annoying ads. This game is pointless and not worth the time it takes to download. Also, the design is really ugly to look at.",1
"When the ads last longer than the game play, you are doing it wrong.",1
Illogical number of ads..,1
"Awful, ads during the levels, ads after the levels ads literally 90% of the time",1
Couñtmasterscrow,1
Ads ads ads. 10 seconds levels and 20 seconds ad after level. Uninstalled after 7 levels.,1
"Pretty much unusable with 30-60 seconds worth of ads for every ten seconds of game play. No real skill or challenge involved. Deleted after about ten mins, eight of which were stuck watching ads.",1
"O,😱🤔",1
Wish I could give 0 stars. Pure ads,1
You will spend more time watching adverts than playing,1
Too many ads. More ads than gametime....,1
Too many ads.,1
"Rubbish, To many AD'S to enjoy the game.",1
Drag to move click hijacking ads. Game is split between short game and ad sessions. I expected nothing else,1
Woulda been a good game had there not been any ads within the first 5 minutes,1
An ad after every single level is unacceptable. 20sec level- 30 sec ad-20sec level - 30sec ad is very annoying.,1
"The game is cool, but I deleted this game because of its many ads",1
"Jeez, ads after each round are at easy twice longer than the round itself. I got done after 5 minutes with this thing. Easier with the greed, dev.",1
can you put even more adds into it?,1
"Thankfully, the Ads came after the first and seconds levels, which were longer the levels. No Brainer to uninstall so not to waste my time waiting for Ads instead of playing the game.",1
"I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this game out. This isn't a game, this is torture.. the title should be renamed to Ad Masters! This game is 90% ads without any option to skip and 10% stickman action. I seriously doubt anyone plays this game. The amount of ads are THAT ridiculous! I am uninstalling this game right now and strongly suggest you avoid this game...",1
So many adverts.....,1
Too much and annoying advertising! And levels are the same. I didn't like it,1
Ads ads ads... Every 10 seconds lasting 30 seconds... Crazy!,1
This game is kinda good but not that good cuz there too maney adds like when u play an add comes up like bro no and when u finish'd the round theres an add!! Noooo stop to muck they need to remove the adds!!!,1
Soooooo many ads,1

This game is boring,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Ads all the time,1

Would be a fun game if we didn't have to go through 5 ads within the first 3 minutes. Horrible user experience.,1
Too many ads. Waste of time,1
Idli,1
too many ads,1
Literally just an ad generator,1
This is just another ad farm. Ad banisters and video ads for every level.,1
"Ads will not go away even if you turn off the data/internet. It's not about work smarter not work harder kind of thing. The point is you'll get ads no matter what, so this game is trash honestly, if only they make the ads as an optional.",1
You get to play a game in this ad simulator,1
Advert advert advert advert ............,1
"To much advertising, boring game.",1
Ad may contain a game.,1
"Everything that everyone else said plus, going from left to right of vice versa seems to b way messed up. There's no in-between. I absolutely love this game, but I can't keep dealing with crashes. Send like everytime u get more people it freezes. Very sad. Fix your game!!!!!!!",1
"There is no real game play, it's just constant advertising. Avoid this game!",1
As soon as I saw a policeman as an enemy I uninstalled.,1
Your ads are way too much,1
Disgusting,1
Ad machine.,1
Ads after literally anything you do in this game. You can't make any move without an ad popping up. You spend far more time in ads than the game itself. STAY AWAY!,1
"So many ads, I can't seen to even play!!! Awful!!!",1
Just a boring game no challenge at all its made easy on purpose so you will watch the ads every time. Not even fulluly developed,1
An advertising app which comes with a game,1
Auto installed another game via pop-up,1
This is ad player,1
I'm only going to give this game one stars because there are way too many ads which makes this game frustrating.,1
Too many ads don not install its waste of time pathetic experience,1
Ads after literally every single level. Mind numbing game but annoying ad level.,1
So many ads! Not worth your time,1
Too many adverts,1
So many ads!!!,1
Loads of ads. Boring,1
"Braindead cashgrab, barely a game. What kind of idiot actually plays this?",1
You'll spend more time with ads on this game than actually playing. Levels are elementary at best.,1
Bombarded with constant ads between rounds,1
"Every level forced ads, Uninstalled after 5 min. Don't waste my time",1
Too many ads in the game! Uninstalling,1
"Fun game. To many ads, its just another ad collector clicker game.",1
Super forced adds. Avoid.,1
Hahahahaha,1
Sorry I didnt like this game I played like 2 levels and got bored so I dont really recommend this if your bored cuz like yeah and its basically the same thing over and over and over again so-,1
Too many ads,1
Download this game and watch 700 trillion billion quadrillion adds. And get only ten seconds of gametime...... Duh OK....,1
Very bad game,1
worst game too many ads..... there is limit of everything but they don't have any limit every time you clear a stage you get another ad..... literally the worst game ever💩💩,1
"I like the premise but the controls are terrible. I swipe left, right, it don't matter... It registers my first maneuver but then doesn't the rest of the level. I don't know if the ads interfere or what but uninstalled after level 2 because the controls don't work.",1
Total waste of time each add between each game is longer than the game itself,1
So many freaking ads! Devs are pure greedy. What happened to games with value?,1
Too many ads,1
Muito ruim muita propaganda.,1
They cheat at there own game for prize that doesn't do anything untill you watch 5 minute ad. Don't down load there scumbags,1
"Very bad game. I have Xiami Redmi Note 8 phone( its good ) but the game drops to 5 fps. I dont want to speak about adds, every ducking level, the level last about 20 secs, and then you watch a 30 secs add. Nice work guys, 1 star!",1
"I was gonna download and play this game but the ad for it is one giant piece of .. here try this game out and guide these people left and right except when you try it takes you to the play store... So you don't even get to try it, they tried to trick me.. what does that say about the game? Misleading, untrustworthy, etcetera. Not to mention all the reviews for it point to a horrible ad bugged game. Thanks for the tips reviewers and thanks for the trick ad developers, you'll lose all your ★s",1
Too much bugs and ads...,1
Halfway finished? Currency that does nothing.,1
ADs Simulator (Deleted),1
Spam ads - Not worth your time,1
"Tired of games where you actually have to play? Well look no further, this is the ultimate ad generation game! Every 15-20 seconds you get a new ad experience that's the hardest thing to click out of. Forget actual gameplay, this games all about ads, so if you're looking for a game where you continuously hit a little white X, then this is it!",1
"No point into playing this, bad publisher, bad.",1
Ok game but lots of adverts that can not be skipped even after waiting for 2 minutes. More advert watching than actual playing.,1
"I installed this just to give 1* review. Stop pushing these stupid add loaded ""games"" please",1
"Game, ad, game, ad, game, ad, game, ad. You spend equal time doing both.",1
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐,1
Easy game that has No orogress after you buy all the lands with gems 1/5 not worth your time :/,1
"Don't understand the point. It's not a maths game eg closely match the opponent number but higher, its not strategy as you can just move your group to avoid obstacles and as others state, 30 seconds of play is x4 long ads. Uninstalled already.",1
افتضاح,1
For when you run it glitch's it also look's fun on ads but it is not.,1
Tooooo many ads aaaaaa,1
All ads no game,1
Too much ads.... Too much irritation...,1
Super glitchy horrible I moved one way it just swims me out of the map,1
I'm ok with adds to play the game but sometimes there's 3 adds per level that's a bit much,1
If your idea of fun is watching endless commercials for other games....great. Otherwise don't bother.,1
Too many ads,1
Lots of ads.. boring,1
"wow...the privacy policy on this game and so many similar games is unbelievable... yo.. just saying.. if you play this game.. you're being played, good luck",1
"Can you say advertisement overload? The game is cute, not difficult at all, but you wind up watching more ads than gameplay. Not good. Not a game I want taking up space on my phone. Deleted.",1
Soooo many apps,1
More ads then game,1
Way too many ads. Whether you win or lose there is an ad...delete,1
کس خار مادتون با این بازی مزخرف و تکراری🖕,1

A lot of ads,1
Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very bad,1
Way too many ads👎,1
Not new,1
Awful! the Ad every every level completely ruins the fun of the game and only seeks to inconvenience you by making you watch an ad of up to 30 seconds every level! I wouldn't mind every few level but every level is beyond a joke!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!,1
"Not a game, it is an ad player app.",1
"Love this new... But... The ads are far too frequent! I don't mind an occasional ad as you need to make SOME revenue off of yours ""free"" app, but After EVERY level, really? Will reinstall if that changes You got your 30¢ from me...",1
0 FPS + Infinite Unresponsive Ads = Unplayable Garbage!,1
Ads you can't X out of every. Single. Level. Good game in general. But when a level goes for like 10-15 seconds maybe(Not counted- it's quick though). Then you have 30sec ad you can't exit. It is not worth it.,1
Game ok'ish But its 10seconds of play 30seconds of adverts. Uninstalled,1
SO MANY ADS,1
Only add,1
Too many ads not worth playing,1
All ads no game,1
When I get a lot it gets laggy so it's not fair,1
"If there wasn't an ad after every damn level it would be a nice game to kill time, just change that and optimize the game a little more and you've got a good enough game. Right now however, don't install you're going to eat more ads than you'll play the game.",1
Too many ads #Uninstall,1
Adverts after every level. Avoid,1
Game is good but too many ads destroyed it.,1
Terrible,1
After a while they noticed am actually good at the game so it started lagging and then it crashed it's rigged,1
Gu khou tum,1
The best app ever,1
I'm not going to make it from you,1
Ad central! 3 steps to close an ad.,1
"Don't make it for free if profit is your only purpose...just be direct and ask for money, and if your product is worth it you shouldn't find a problem gaining profit, instead of a non stop stream of useless adds...A fairly fun game, an outrageously ugly strategy of making money...too bad!",1
Too many adds awful,1
Never seen so many ads in one app... ridiculous...,1
Game is made to extract as much advert cash as possible.i have played this upto level 112 and every level is extremely easy lasting 20secs max all levels basically the same with little imagination involved.advert after every 20secs level.from my time playing it therecwas very little challenge but they did get about 150 adverts out of me so well played on that part that's where the one star come from 😀,1
To much ads,1
Too many ads,1
Watched more ads than played.,1
No option to get rid of ads,1
To many ads and it lags allot,1
"How can no one beat the 1st level, y'all are noobs this game is way too easy but too many ads",1
Waaaaaaay too many ads,1
"Adds after adds, close add icon very small. Not recommended unless you like to watch adds whole day.",1
delate,1
"Deleted after 5 minutes, ads after every level. More ads than gameplay.",1
One star bc the ads make me mad,1
So many adverts it's crazy,1
This game is very good game and I love this game,1
Seriously? You couldn't fit in more ads??,1
The number of ads in this game is just excessive. This isn't a game with occasional ad breaks. It's an advertisement with occasional quick games.,1
"Trash, too many ads and if you go offline it stops you from playing",1
Toooooooo MANY ADSSSSSSS!!!!!!! DELETE NOW!!!!!,1
❤️❤️💝❤️❤️,1
"Uninstalled it after 3 mins. The game is nice but there are a lot of ads and some of them are missing the X button so you can't close them. You have tho close the entire game, then to restart and play again. Annoying ads who destroys a nice game.",1
Too much ads it's unplayable,1
Too many ads. Romved it from the device already. Not worth keeping.,1
I would say this is a good game but the adds are outrageous there us an add per level and that is very frustrating!,1
More ads then game. Plat a level then watch ads.,1
Too many ads haven't even played a minute.,1
Nice app,1
Dhnaraj Ghidode,1

Another lazy attempt at gaining money through as sales. I got an ad in the middle of a level during game play. Mobile game jerk circle,1
You'll spend more time on the adverts than playing the game.,1
លឿន,1
It is a bad game when we are playing it will be stucked.More than this there is ads I was very enoyed with it.And this is for person who made this (if you are making such games please make a good game that we could enjoy.,1
𝓢𝓾𝓹𝓮𝓻,1
Ads basically every single level or time you do anything,1
Too many ads. I uninstalled it because the game isn't worth the hassle and time I have to sit through the ads to play it.,1
It there worst and boring game I've ever played the is nothing interesting it like repeating the same level,1
Waste of network in this game lots of ads this game is so boring,1
Ne hd mood,1
Ads...,1
Ads ads and more ads,1
"Ads, ads and more ads. Delete",1
You are insulting muslims and Christians structure ... Behind that big men ... Whyy,1
No comment....another poorly made game..,1
Played first 5 levels and ad after every single level...garbage,1
3 words. Too. Many. Ads.,1
"I recently read an article about android security that if you just install an app and it needs updated right away that sometimes the app looks/acts like something else. Example.. a calculator app that functions as a calculator but at the same time downloads and installs other things. So why is it I just installed this app not even 5 mins ago yet it needs an update? Also what's the ""run at startup"" permission needed for????? Be careful everyone....",1
download htna,1
If you love watching ads this game is for you.,1
Bad game!!!! Everytime I finish a level there is an ad! A long ad! Not recommended!!👎👎👎👎,1
"Deleting this ad heavy game. I don't mind some ads, but this is ridiculous. I only wish i could give these gready devs minus 5 stars.",1
Nice,1
10 sec gameplay 30 sec ads. Shockingly bad. Boring. Terrible. Worst of anything have tried,1
One boss is a cop who gets destroyed by the crowd. Un-American! Absoluty offensive!,1
Well it would have got more stars but not nearly enough advertisements. I mean only one ad after every 5 second map ... Come on guys you could have an ad after every blue barrier that adds more troops you could get it up to 10+ ads a level ... I hate a game that ruins good advertisement watching time by making me play it.,1
Avoid! Game is riddled with ads! Uninstalled in less the 5 minutes,1
Play for 3 seconds then watch a 30 second ad. Yay.,1
First 10 minutes I was forced to watch a dozen ads. It's just not fun,1
Trash,1
"It's lazy, badly done, and just pure bait for people to download so they can make revenue from shoving ads down your throat. Avoid like the plague",1
Advert after every go not fun 🙃,1
The number of adds and length of them make this too frustrating to play. Uninstalling.,1
A load of rubbish!,1
In every play u make u need to watch ads to continue your fun🤪😔🙄 waste of time duh,1
Worst game ever,1
"Was fine until a message popped up in game asking for a system restarted because ""it was 14 days out of date"". What rubbish and most likely some virus. Will never touch a game by this company again.",1
Ads every 10 seconds,1
លើផ,1
I will give more than three star but it has too many adds,1
"I thought this was gonna be fun but its not it had alot of adds every I finish the level there's a add, and so laggy, don't download this game its just a waste of time",1
ADVERT LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Privacy issues,1
This would be a fun game but there is an ad after every level you complete. I understand ads help keep games free but the amount they have in this game is beyond excessive.,1
For the ppl complaining about ads turn off your wifi and you get no ads,1
Get rid of even hf the ad's would make it worth playing far too many ad's,1
Ads,1
"It is amazing to me. I think you have done it. You have made a game that cannot possibly be worse. Complete lack of effort, graphics look like they were made by my 6 year old cousin. If you fail one of these levels you must be in preschool. It gets repetitive after the 2nd level. There's no point in it. Not to mention it feels like i downloaded an advertisement with mini games. I hope everyone deletes this game. They are making bank off a game that took 2 days to make.",1
"Fun could be worth it, but it's really just an ad pusher. Uninstalled after 5mins. :(",1
Far too many ads,1
It's actually an advertising app. In between they may gave us some level to play.. But remember after every advertisement you will get chance to play one time. Ok Bye.,1
Too much ads. Easy game hard to not lose. Ads. Boring.,1
"It's just another ad filled, fake demo ad, copy and paste game. You also can't use most of the features without internet, but if you turn on internet you keep getting spammed with ads. Not worth it.",1
Full of adds,1
Literally 10 seconds of play level then a 30 second ad.,1
Add before game and after,1
After 5 seconds of gameplay you get 40 seconds of ads... not worth it.,1
Overwhelming Ads,1
The amount of ads makes this near impossible to play,1
ads to moch,1
Soooooo an annoying! The game is flooded with advertising that I couldn't actually enjoy the game. Uninstalled. Waste of time.,1
"Fun concept, horrible amount of 30sec ads. Good God you have to watch an ad for every button click you make on this game. Then you have to do an ad after each level. I get that ppl want to make money but chill out a bit and you might keep people like me interested.",1
Ads even if i want to watch A ad for a reward and if i pick lose the reward itll give me a ad anyways plus too much ads.,1
"I never write reviews cliché, but this game has no purpose besides Ad revenue. You have 9 skins, and Gems are pointless. The levels are comically easy, and you have to watch an Ad for each level. Your prizes require mandatory videos that are unskippable. This game belongs in the dumpster.",1
"Ad generator, levels are 15-20 seconds long and ads are 30 to 40 seconds. 80%ads 20%gameplay. Uninstalled",1
"Might have been a fun game, but my god, the ads. I only got through 2 games then immediately uninstalled it. Not even an option to pay to remove ads. But honestly, if there was, I don't think I would. This game is what's wrong with mobile gaming.",1
I don't like it,1
Like ads? Get this! Such a shame..,1
One of these games where you spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game. Waste of life.,1
"ADS, ADS, ADS AND SOME MORE ADS",1
Ad ad and more ads,1
To many damn adds,1
Really fun game but waaaaaayyyyy too many ads. Would gladly pay to get rid of them but doesn't look like that is even an option.,1
Too many ads,1
"Too many ads, ruins the experience. You literally spend 30 seconds playing then there's a 30 second ad. I uninstalled after 1 hour.",1
WAY TO MANY ADS!!!!!!!!,1
Bekar hai add bohot jyada hai bar bar hang ho jata hai,1

Csjnsja hznsia he usually ja ua. In his uncut h in. I. Y bunch,1
To many ads. Every 10 seconds,1
Toooooooo many ads,1
"The ads are longer than the levels, and there are soooo many ads you can tell they're trying to force you to buy the ad free version. The game is simple but in 30mins of play over half will be ads. If you don't mind spending money this game will be fun for you to play!",1
Game full-on ads,1
Wrost game ever their are same level and thier was no change if you will download this game so you always win because their is no difficulties in this game,1
You literally dont do anything in this game except pick the highest number. Diamonds do nothing in this game. No unlockables. No nothing,1
"LONG ads after every level - even the short training levels at the beginning of the game. And, there's no way to skip the long ads after 5 or 10 seconds. I uninstalled it. It could've been a fun game. Too bad the publisher was more interested in ad revenue than user experience. There are other games on the play store with the same premise that are far superior and don't ruin the mood of the game by burying you in ads. If I could give this zero stars, I would.",1
TOOOOO MANYYYY ADSSSS. UNINSTALL DONE✅ every click you will see ads. Done waste your time.,1
It's not worth it,1
Lot of adds,1
So many adds,1
Way too many ads cant even enjoy the game. Its understandable that there may be some ads but this is just too much,1
It's disgusting,1
A taste of hell. So. Many. Ads. So. Little. Entertainment.,1
Holy **** ads. There's an add every 10 seconds or so.,1
Tooooooooo much ads,1
I love game 😔😔,1
Ads are forced after every level and on top of that you need to watch an ad to increase how many coins you get to be able to advance I played 4 levels took me around 3mins but my total play time is 11mins after waiting for all the ads.,1
Add for every level. It's bs,1
I hate this game,1
Boring so many ads,1
The game is hang on play,1
Too any ads,1
Way too many ads. Virtually one ad after every round,1
Not good,1
Garbage. Also: too many ads. Don't waste your time on this game.,1
Sometimes between the ads you can play! After an hour I installed!,1
too many ads,1
"Dreadful app. Ads after every level, after one reward there was two ads. Deleted. Avoid",1
It freezes a lot and wasn't that fun to begin with.,1
These ads are killing me can you please stop throwing ads in the users face its annoying af,1
I love the game but it felt like I was watching more ads than actually playing the game.,1
If you spend much time playing this game you can even see that it bcoz of your enemies and you,1
its so gliche,1
Forced to watch an ad before every level and sometimes more than that. I hate it.,1
This game stucking and this game is intersting game but 1 problem this is worst game,1
Way to many ads really stupid game,1
"Here's a strategy for you guys, use airplane mode when playing the game so that you aren't spammed with ads every 3 seconds, play the game in peace, rate it horribly after finishing, and delete it. That's what I did!",1
Worst ad experience I've ever seen. Can't get into a rythm. Not worth it.,1
No way to pay to disable ads,1
Repetitive game money hungry owners because all that is there is as you just dont play the game because there are so many ads,1
One dam AD after another at the end of each stage. Don't waste your time. Not worth it.,1
"Unbelievable amount of ads, no thank you",1
To many darn ads junk junk junk,1
"Game is really nice. But the shameless ads are next level. First ads were muted, then unmuted with the option tu mute, then unmuted withkut an option to mute. Thats just greedy dudes. I cant support games like this sorry",1
ads,1
A lot of ads. A lot.,1
Too many ads After each level you will get ads Worst game ever,1
Relentless ads,1
Too many ads!!,1
So many ads it's barely playable. Fun for about 35 seconds,1
Ridiculous ads,1
Bad game ever,1
"This game was created and only created to play ads to you. I played this game all of ten seconds and uninstalled. You are force fed ads after every level. And for reference, the ad lasts longer than the level.",1
Bc add,1
"I saw hope you like ads, even if you turn off your WiFi, they still give you ads, end of every level, oh what's that you want a different colour guy, watch a ad you might get the colour you want if not watch a ad",1
Please don't play this game if you play this game a lot and if you can log into your Roblox account or your your your usual account on YouTube for Tik Tok that means they hijacked it Dimitri still all the information do not play it somehow I got mines back everything a on the information that never got stolen but if you put Caulking and do with this at Graham you're are going to be dead they can hijack account and if you see someone recording you you much run that is m dim stay safe😔,1
This game has a ridiculous amount of ads playing almost constantly. So frustrating! I had this game installed for 5 minutes and I'm uninstalling already.,1
Too oooo many adds and app long between then boaring,1
A lot of Adds,1
"Way too easy. There's no challenge at all, unless you dropped out of third grade and are too incompetent to do simple addition. It's pretty repetitive, and gets boring very quickly. And that's just the actual gameplay; this is one of those games that will show you an ad after every ""round"", so to say. I should mention it's not a poorly designed game, and I don't give out 1 star reviews lightly.",1
Nice game but the amount of ads is out of this world... I know it's free but it would be nice to be able to play at least 2-3 level in a row without ads.,1
Waste game👎👎👎,1
Shady privacy policy collecting your information and sharing it to whomever they want. And if they can't make income off that then they spam you with ads not a good product,1
Way too many ads.,1
Little to no control over your player and ads interrupt you while you play. Very annoyed.,1
There is so many adds the game doesn't deserve a single star,1
"Horrible just horrible, to many ads that last way too long. And the levels are like 10 long.",1
Uninstaled it because of the ads.,1
"This game SUCKS if you ask me way to many ads and it's not fun I mean I played it for maybe a week and now I hate it it's easy ,ads are every where, and when unlock a new skin you have to watch a ad for it ! When I saw that I was pretty mad 😡",1
Uses the kinds of ads that look like playable ads but they really just take you here to try to get you to install the game. Tricking people is not nice and gets one star reviews.,1
Too much advertisement,1
It's not a game it's ads,1
This game would be great without the adverts. The adverts even make my phone freeze,1
This game is good overall. But those ads are annoying... it's totally rubbish. Specially that food treatment ad...🤮🤮🤮....,1
AdFest,1
Bakwas,1
Wrost game,1
Too many ads and bugs.,1
No many ads you can't even play the game,1
Good game... 1 star for the unskippable ads that show up.,1
Too many ads,1
Very bad full ad,1
To many ads. It keeps bothering me to play. This is highly annoying. So annoying that I removed the game and left this review.,1
I hate this game,1
Not,1
This game would he great if the developers weren't so unintelligent with their ridiculous ad placements,1
"I ad don't ad know ad how ad people af play ad this ad game ad without ad a ad ad ad blocker ad. It's ad no ad joke ad the ad amount ad of ad ads ad that ad you ad get ad in ad this ad game ad. Gameplay ad was ad mediocre ad. Seriously ad though ad, ads ad.",1
For every levels adds are disturbing,1
Adverts every time somebody farts,1
"Too much ad, deleted the game after playing 3 levels",1
More ad time then game time.,1
Has potential. I immediately delete an app that holds me hostage to play another app before I can get back to the game I don't reward greed. An ad after everything. Forget it.,1
Unacceptable amount of ads even for a free game.,1
Ad after every short round. It's fun but wow at least add a option for like $1-3 to remove them. Probably would make more that way when you have a good game,1
Too many ads bro,1
The amount of adds is unbearable. Could be fun but this is too much.,1
"Awful ads, forcing you to watch without skipping",1
ad simulator without music ...,1
Bad hame,1
ужас..фуу,1
"Ads after every level! Too many, game not worth it",1
"This game is horrendous. Every round you're subjected to ads, the ads are more enjoyable than the actual game",1
Nice game,1
Crashes my other games please go die somewhere,1
"Too much of ads, game is interesting but the ads made me to uninstall the app.",1
"Fivel levels and five ads? Forget about it. This app has potential to be good, but the sheer volume of ads makes it unplayable",1
Pratham,1
So many ads,1
More ads than game play,1
Too many adds. Not enjoying,1
It starts out okay then it gets super glitchy and starts freezing up and they jump all over the screen and run past the checkpoints where your team is supposed to multiply and sometimes run past the red crew too it needs a lot of work to stabilize it and fix the glitches and jumping all over the screen.,1
Badddff,1
"It is a plesant game to play. It is a simple game, a very nice way to lose track of time. Problem is that aster each round, you get an add, for each upgrade, an qdd, for each bonus, an add. This app was created just as a add platform, nothing more. I would have kept on playing if they were half of this (I guess I have a high tolerance for adds).",1
i installed it and it just would not open!,1
so aweful .. full of advertising and very low resolution,1
Ad at the end of each level ( yawn board after 10 minutes),1
"Fun game, ADS RUIN THE EXPIRIANCE. Play a 15 second round, then watch a 30 second ad after EVERY round. If this game had 1/4- 1/2 the ads it has now it would be understandable but come on....",1
Alot of add i hate that,1
"Full of ads, they made the game for ads purposes only nothing else",1
Muy malo,1
Ad spam :/,1
Too many ads,1
The game is really nice but not easy to win and how far you get how harder it gets,1
20sec round 30sec ad.. not worth my time.,1
WAY too many ads.,1
No no god please no noooooooooooo,1
"Way overboard with adverts which is a shame because I'd like to play this game, but I cba with the constant ads. Ruins the whole thing.",1
"Cool concept to kill time....but a video add after every, EVERY single round is just super annoying....get rid of that and reduce it to one add after 5 rounds or so and I'll reinstall....",1
Won't even download,1
Unplayable. nonstop ads!!! I skip a skin which otherwise would be unlocked by watching an ad and it plays an ad anyways. 30 minutes in and it's still as simple as which number is bigger... (×3) or (x5),1
Too many adverts,1
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕,1
This ads game ads contains ads way ads too ads many ads ads ads to ads be ads any ads fun ads at ads all!!! (Ads),1
"Too many ads and lvls pretty much the same ,,, no 🤔🤔",1
Waaaaayyyy too many adds,1
Gameplay is uninteresting and ads play every 20 seconds.,1
"The game is kinda fun, but there are so many ads it's completely impossible to enjoy it.",1
Trash.,1
The game is too easy,1
Ad after ad after ad. Can't even play the game,1
Alot of ads. No time to play the actual game.,1
"Just another money grabbing game. Excessive ads for short gameplay. Very simplistic with little added to appeal to gamers. I recommend not installing, but if your truly interested, just turn data and wifi off when playing",1
UmeshHaVeri,1
The ads are too much. Immediate uninstall.,1
The play to add ratio is rediculous. I play a level for 10 seconds and watch a 30 second ad. Waste of time.,1
"Boring, repetitive, and 1 or 2 ads after every screen. Not a good game.",1
Played the first level then ads. Played the second level then ads then deleted it.,1
F'n horrible app! Just an app to deliver ads for really stupid games. Watching ads literally takes longer than each stage.,1
"Game is terrible, ads after every run. You build up a multiplier to get a skin only you have to watch another ad to unlock the skin that you spent time saving up to??? Mechanics are broken and boring. Just stop making games, they're soo bad 🤣",1
Waaaaaay too many ADS...,1
Continual useless ads for other continual ad games. Pure trash.,1
It's just ads,1
Worst game ever it's more of add show than a game ... You deserve 0 stars .,1
Thrash,1
This prompts many adds to install other games that is worse,1
Great app and easy to uninstall!,1
Too many ads,1
installed uninstalled way 2 many ads!! I undersrand some ads but come on this is way 2 much,1
😐,1
If i could rate 0 i would. EVERY TIME I GET PROGRESS OR A HIGH AMOUNT IT MYSTERIOUSLY GLITCHES then i have to get out and BAM...ERASED. REAL NICE 👍 DON'T DOWNLOAD.,1
The vast majority of time is spent in ads. Even skipping a reward given by watching an ad gives you an ad anyway.,1
agree with the last review - WAY to many ads,1
Sucks. Remove ads and maybe I'll review a little more,1
This is the one of the worse games that I have ever played it is so glitch I do not recommend it just to up space in my phone 😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤,1
"Ads, ads, ....,,.....,......... Ads",1
Game khele ya tumari advantage dekhate bhethe. Faltu game he,1
"Gets very boring easily, sometimes they make you lose troops and you cant do anything about it, but even then its so easy that its boring.",1
Way too many ads,1
Too much adds,1
The amount of advertising is horrific. There's advertising at the bottom of the screen and after you finish the each level. On top of that the advertisements are longer than the level.,1
"I don't know why I can't control my armies.. If I try to double them, then they are decreasing... May be technical issues.. I didn't like it🙏🙏🙏.....",1
Watch ads before you claim your own reward👎,1
"The amount of adds render this game practically unplayable. Unskippable, unmutable adds after EVERY SINGLE level, is insanely too much. It's actually quicker and less hassle, to close the game and reopen it than to watch the actual add",1
"The game is kinda cool, but there are noisy, cumbersome ads after every single level. For perspective, 10 second level, 30+ second ad. Unbelievable. Don't waste your time. Literally.",1
Doodie,1
Do you like watching ads every 20 seconds this game is for you. Trash company.,1
"Played two rounds, saw two adds, adds took longer than the rounds. Deleted. Wont recommend.",1
95% adds 1% game 4% loading times,1
Too many ads.,1
Too manu ads,1
Forced ad after every level makes this game unplayable,1
It's good,1
This game was so bad,1
Too many ads,1
Ads after every game....,1
Far too many adverts.. I uninstalled.,1
Too many ads 👎,1
Just ad,1
‼️BORING. It was fun to play for 1 hour. The game is too easy. Become boring very fast. TOOOOO MANY ADS 👎👎👎👎,1
Why is it that I have to agree on privacy policy? Why the hunger for data? Why can't I just be calm playing a game? You hunger for power or something? Screw this.,1
Your adds kept bugging me now I hope this one star helps you enjoy,1
"Repetitive game. And if the ads attacks weren't bad enough, after a while it gets stuck at the end of a level and doesn't let you move on to... more of the same? Don't install this for your own sake",1
Don't bother. You'll be watching more ads than playing the game.,1
Too many ads,1
I want to blid but I can't I have 5040 gems when I press to blit it's like the game freeze,1
Tati game,1
If you like ads every 10 seconds then this is the game for you.,1
Too much ads!,1
There is an add after every single level.. which you complete in like 15 seconds. So you spend more time watching adds than even playing. Not a good boredom killer,1
The ads are just too much,1
World worst game so bored,1
The game itself seems pretty enjoyable.. the ads are insesant . Uninstalled after a good 5min play.. half of which were consumed by ads!,1
Just boring and way to many ads.,1
"The idea of this games is cool and different, but having an ad after every single level is extremely annoying. I can't believe that the developers has many games and still, they plaster ads all the time on their games. Do not download this game if ypu don't want to spend over half on the game play waiting for ads.",1
"Way too many ads. Seriously, a lot",1
"I downloaded this game just for the lolz to see what it was about and while i was downloading the game, i saw the ratings and i agree with everyone, way too many ads. After you finish a level, you will certainly get an ad and it's super annoying. I know that the devs have put many ads to earn something but with 10m+ downloads, i think you guys should tone down the ads. Apart from that, no welcome screen, no nothing and it's just a repetitive game. Won't download it again unfortunately. Thanks",1
Its not good,1
Infested with ads. 10 seconds of gameplay followed by 2 minutes of ads.....,1
fun game to many ads,1
Another horrible Advertising game. Yall just want people to get this game and literally waste their own time with COUNTLESS of ads. Not worth it.,1
"Fun idea, terrible execution. Levels are too easy and incredibly short (we're talking 20 seconds). After every level (or failed attempt) you have to watch an ad that takes as much time, or more, as playing the level. As an endless runner type game, this would be a lot more fun. And pull down the ads, for gods sake.",1
Ad after every level. Levels take 20 seconds ad's take twice as long. Do not install this garbage!,1
Too many ads. Don't try this game,1
I dont like it its very laggy and its annoying and its kinda boring. To many ads I mean having ads isn't bad but having to much is,1
Great Game!,1
horrible ads impossible to close,1
"Has potential to be fun, but the ads are ridiculous. Basically seems like a virus with the ads.",1
Wow This Is The Worst Game Ever It's Zero Stars.,1
Boring,1
More adds than gameplay,1
Too many ads,1
Ok I am not supposed to rate apps but I am doing this one so ummm well I am 10 years old and I usually like dorky and weird games that some people find not so cool but this one is just not me after a while you can't play it I would rate it 0 it would allready be done by now do not download it see ya lader alligator✌PEACE,1
This could be a fun game except the ads are absurdly frequent. They literally ruin the experience.,1
Too many ads,1
You spend as much time watching ads as you do playing the game. What's the point? It's a half decent game which just pushes you to download games from other devices. Played for 30 minutes and watched 15 minutes of ads. Uninstallled!,1
"The amount of lag is just stupid. It makes me lose and takes away the good side of the game. There are also ads after every level and when you go up ramps to avoid the razors, if your group is over 100 some get taken away even I'd you don't touch the razors...don't recommend downloading. If you enjoy lag and ads this is the game for you.",1
WAY too much lag and too many ads.,1
"Game is unplayable. After each turn (which last around 20 seconds) you have to watch an advert. So I've deleted the game. If it was an advert every 5 turns I'd keep playing it, but it's not so I wont. Advertising so much on a game like this has made me delete the game for good which as a result means I am not watching any of the adverts you want me to watch. If it was every so often I would keep the game and in theing tun watch more adverts. You've done you own legs by being greedy",1
Toooooo much ads and its laggy,1
"The game is ok, however, the amount of adds is unbearable! You get an ad for every level and even when you click on no for the ""special points"" it gives you an ad. It seems that the device are just a bit too greedy...",1
Way too many adverts.,1
An ad after every level and necessary to purchase upgrades woowwww,1
5 second map and get 15 second ads after each map.,1
Too easy.,1
So many ads you do almost nothing else,1
Ad generator and no skill involved,1
"Scam, you spend more time watching ads, then you do playing the game. Waste of time, removed Immediately!!!",1
"This is just total clickbait, it could have been an alright time passing game, but the fact that each level lasts about 10 seconds before a 30 second advertisement is just unforgivable. There was clearly next to no effort put into this game so that they could get a mucm money as possible",1
Way too many adverts.,1
Your game sucks,1
the ads after each level last longer than the gameplay preceding it. What a hunk of garbage!,1
"The game is so boring and easy, and there are a million adsafter each 10 second level that take 20 seconds to finish, which surprisingly they even play without internet So don't cmon don't diwnload this game, I do make games on my own and its the gameplay takes less than an hour to develope",1
"This app is not a game, it's just a front for Ads.",1
"Short boring rounds followed by excessive ads every time, I have to close the app to get out of them. Not worth the space on my phone or my time and attention.",1
"Why does there have to be an ad after every single level. At least let me go every 5 minutes and then get one, or something along those lines. I only played 3 levels and had to uninstall.",1
Way too many ads.,1
"Absolute garbage. Could be fun, but no sound + plagued with adverts (although my network ad blocker prevented that). Dull rounds, zero replayability. Wouldn't even bother. Clearly made as an advertising platform.",1
Worst game,1
Bad I CANT EVEN DOWNLOAD IT!,1
"Played 2 levels, got 2 ads -- not worth the time",1
Mandatory multiple ads watching after every move.,1
"Way too many ads. I'm getting ads immediately after I complete the level, sometimes before the level animation is even finished.",1
An advert every level is ridiculous,1
Just a roll of ads,1
"The choices are actually illusory, the game is just there to run ads between runs. Ads take more time than gameplay.",1
fun concept but extremely repetitive - once you've played the first level you've played them all,1
Absolutelly useles. Just adds every few minutes.,1
Waste of time advertisement time is more than pkaying time game is good and awesone but waste of time every single stage i complete i m getting a advertisement sometimes double ad,1
Too many ads! You can't do anything without having to watch an ad afterwards. Also the ads somehow were on full volume even when my phone was on silent,1
Not a game! More like a giant ad with small breaks...,1
"Deleted after 5mins, ads are a joke!",1
I love the game but every single time you pass a level there is an unskippable ad and that ruins the game for me also the game is pretty glitchy 😪,1
Tooo much ads. Every level you win there's a 30 second ad. Worst experience. One level is about 45 seconds followed by 30 second ad.,1
too mutch advertised,1
So many adds,1
Horrible app due to the amount of lag I couldn't play 1 game/round without it glitching,1
Just a bunch of ads,1
Look the game is really bad it had a lot of lags and the ads are longer than the game,1
Constant adverts!!!!! AVOID,1
"1 star becuase it's fun. Well no I can't give it a zero rating. The volume of ads in this game is insane. You can watch three ads back to back, then 30s later watch another 2. Game lasted 10 minutes on my phone before I sent it to the grave.",1
I love u ❤❤💋💋💋💋❤,1
Gay,1
"Ads ads ads. More time watching ads than playing. Pity, game was mildly amusing. Nope nope nope nope",1
Ads,1
Bad,1
I hate it,1
Too many long ads. I'm out.,1
Dogshit and full of ads,1
Too much ads,1
Worst app no comments only a word that is worst app don't waste time here not worth it,1
Won't let me download,1
To much ads!,1
it stucks a lot even on good hardware.,1
"What a complete joke of a game, levels take 10 seconds to complete and then you get a 15-30 second ad over and over. Don't waste your time unless you love watching ads more than playing a game.",1
"Runs pretty badly, some ads don't even finish (screen goes black then game restarts) and there are no settings whatsoever, especially to change the sensitivity of how fast the people move. Couldn't even play it for 10 minutes. Sorry.",1
Pub pub et pub... Voici un résumé de ce jeu.,1
Thank you,1
Drowning in ads,1
"Too many Ads.A level takes 20 sec to complete on average then a 30s advert rinse and repeat,you spend more time watching adverts than actually playing the game.I like the game and I understand the developer needs revenue,but most other popular games are much much fairer regarding forced and in most cases non forced Ads.",1
"the amount of ads is bad, sure, but there's no mute volume option? seriously? what game doesn't let you turn the volume off?",1
Full of ads and bugs,1
Ad spam. Uninstalled,1
Are there any games out there other than king games ??? games that don't have billions of ads and a few seconds of game play ?????? ads that are so intolerable You can't enjoy a game,1
More play less ads please,1
Trash it won't let me download it :(,1
Too many ads,1
🗑🚮,1
Its poo and ugly,1
to many ads.........useless game😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒,1
Way too many ads. And you cant skip em. Horrible!,1
Too many ads,1
To many ads,1
"Waaaaay more ads than gameplay, yo play a 10 seconds long level, followed by a 35 seconds ad, then you get the rewards for beating said level, you spend the gold and are rewarded with another 35 seconds ad, you play the next 10 seconds long level and are greeted with another 35 seconds ad. So total playtime is just under 2 minutes, of which you only spend 20 seconds playing. Over 80% of the time is spent on ads i whish i didn't even install this joke of an app to begin with",1
Fun but should have known after the first level there was a 30 second ad. Played 5 levels and there was a 30 second ad after each one. Don't waste your time. 15 seconds of play then a 30 second ad. Uninstalled!,1
Ads every level ad longer than the level most times.,1
Brand new phone... Every other game (which is far more advanced then this basic game) runs perfect. Played this once and it crashed my phone twice. A waste of space and time,1
Hated the ads after EVERY level.,1
"Gets boring after the first round, nothing new, nothing fun nothing, at all. Do not recomend",1
This app isnt nice for me at all (Ad),1
Ads are longer than the levels,1
"So many ads, almost unplayable !! GONNA UNINSTAL IT NOW I HAVE LEFT REVIEW.....",1
It's a game that likes too much freezes and second of all it does not work I don't know why you guys created this awful,1
So many ads,1
Dhish game is so boring,1
Super,1
Adds and that's about it,1
Too many ads. An add after every extreamly short game makes this very tedius. Would not reccomend,1
Too many ads! Unplayable!!! I Uninstalled within less than 10 min of playing!,1
App to see ads. Game is secondary,1
Always stupid adds don't download waste of time more adds then game play and uses all your data,1
The adds last longer than the game play. Not worth it.,1
Too many ads,1
"Very very careful, catchy game , BUT MILLIONS ADS!!!!!!!!!!!!...... Unfortunately.... Almost unplayable, cos ADS ALL THE TIME!!!!!",1
Too much ads,1
It's so useless game of world. players over to 200 this lag in my mob. 8 GB ram. So I give only one fore this game 🌟 this game,1
"Developer hasn't got a clue. You could have a great game here which generates loads of revenue through reasonable and well placed advertising. Instead you have a game which will have a 90%+ uninstall rate because you put a 20 second ad in every level, with levels lasting 15 seconds. Embarrassingly poor and a waste of an opportunity.",1
Way to many ads,1
"Poorly made, too many ads, patheticly easy and overall just a waste of time.",1
"trash with too much adds, not even worth patching it",1
Some what better,1
"I'm really disappointed , I had downloaded it to play game not to watch add in my free time it's too bad I don't recommend this game",1
Super fun to play 3 seconds of the game then watch a 30 second ad in-between each level.,1
"Useless game,tak guna makan hasil haram iklan bersepah.lannnnnnnn",1
The ads after each level are longer than the level. Garbage,1
Way too many ads,1
Way too many ads.,1
Ad lol,1
Bad,1
Too many ads,1
This an endless ad with a few seconds of gameplay inbetween. Deleted after playing 3 levels.,1
We can not win by having more then 200 of them its imposibal Fix it,1
"Developers: Great Job. The game has a huge potential. May I suggest a more strategic approach to the ads and longer, more engaging levels to get the player hooked. Currently, the game has no real depth to it. Levels are short and there're long ads after each level. Again, game has the potential to be a very addictive game like temple run or flappy bird, but the overflood of ads cause the player to lose interest quickly. Perhaps an endless level option with a leaderboard?",1
Hang and stack,1
nice game,1
Worst game in the world. I paid not to get adds and they literally just gave me shorter adds instead of no adds. And the game is boring too. It glitches a lot and has the most inopropret adds. Dont get this game!,1
"Tons of bugs in this game, can defeat archer group even though have less people compared to them. Starts lagging when receive 200 troops. When have 200+ people, after jumping over another platform the number drastic decrease to 30-50 troops. Also I saw there's a 6.8 multiplier, but I always end up at 6.2, could this be another trick of yours to bait them continue playing the game. Your game su*ck. Absolute garbage game, never recomend to download it. Go download something else.",1
"Too many ads, ads take 15-20 seconds each so you spend more time waiting for ads to end than you do playing.",1
"Fun game, but WAY too many ads. After every 10 second level, you have a 30-60 second ad.",1
Are we playing the game or watching the Ads? I completed the levels in 10 seconds and watching 30 seconds ads.,1
It's gliching and it has more adds than games but you could turn your internet off but it's not good so don't bother downloading it Thank you for listening.,1
When I saw somebody's comment that this game is game between ads and not ads between game... I thought how bad could it be... Trust me this is bad and not at all exaggerated when they say game between ads,1
"Adverts take longer than the levels, makes the game unplayable. Could have been a nice game, but wouldn't recommend anyone wasted their time with it as it is.",1
These games are NOT VERIFIED BY PLAY PROTECT. They are blowing up my cringe sensors. These games abuse children into getting money from ads.,1
Too many ads,1
Data miners! There would be NO so called 'privacy' policy from you if you weren't hacking data theives! No thanks you lovers of despotism!!! :/ Uninstalled obviously!,1
Too much advertising. So annoying,1
Adds adds adds,1
Soon many ads. You get an ad every time you complete a level (the levels aren't even long).,1
"Gets boring fast, if you want an ad free experience turn on airplane mode",1
It's trash an ad after evry level and the levels are extremely short and it lags your device when you go to the homescrean DONT DOWNLODE bad graphics,1
Too many ads,1
After a 2 second round there's an add every time.,1
"Too many ads, worst",1
Well let me start of with the gameplay. Repetitive. Not the best. And absolutely a time easter. The amount of adds poured in you face is tremendous. I know the devs make money of of it but come on.,1
Awful,1
"Gun game but way too many adds, at least triple time spent watching adds vs game play. Ruins the fun completely",1
Gaming less advertising more,1
This game is terrible. I liked the thought of a quick math game with the ad that showed this to me. Downloaded it and played it for 10 minutes before I was so frustrated with ads I deleted the game. Terrible. Absolutely no fun whatsoever and I know it's a free game and you will have as. But SERIOUSLY. Play for 10 seconds and then ad ad ad ad. Igh if I could give thos less than a 1 star I would.,1
Trash,1
If you want to watch advertising play with damn game!,1
"Advertisement after every single level without fail. Ads are inappropriate for younger children and many have sexual and substance use/abuse references, and some last longer than the time it takes to play a level. Uninstalling",1
It keeps on crashing every few bosses.,1
"So. Many. Ads! Every level required you to watch an ad. Every bonus required you to watch an ad. I was watching two or three ads, per level. I'm uninstalling now.",1
This is just app to watch ads,1
I get ads but every 20 seconds,1
"Terrible! ""oh its so hard"" nope. Its ez. Too much ads! Not worth installing.",1
Ads all the time you cant even play this game is not entertaining at all.,1
"Tired of these ad bombed games, I select continue without selecting to watch a video to gain the reward multiplier and I still watch an ad.....developers like these are bottom of the barrel.",1
Too many ads,1
"Super easy, my dog could play this game. Dull.",1
"Ads are way too long, uninstalled.",1
Way too many ads for such a simple game. Its rediculous and ruins all fun. Avoid this game.,1
Made my pp feel bad.,1
Just Disgusting too much lag,1
Just completely add ridde,1
If you love watching adverts that you can't skip in between every level you do then this is the game for you. They should class this as adverts with the occasional game thrown in.,1
Too many ads. You play for 30 seconds and watch 2 minutes worth of ads,1
To much ads,1
"Bad game. Obstacles prevent anything greater than like 110 troops or so. Building base is pointless. Boss ""variety"" is terrible. And worst of all is ads, everything you do. Ad after level, ad after getting a prize. Even an ad if you DECLINE a prize. Ridiculous. Levels are shorter than the dang ads. Game is pointless too. Do not waste time with this game.",1
"The ads, cant go 5 seconds without one",1
too many ads... removing it now...,1
"Has potential to be a good game but the control is not smooth. I gave 1 star for how it forces you to watch an ad. Everything has ads on it, even the bonus stuff that you get. Got the first skin by playing but I need to watch ad that doesn't load and had to say goodbye the skin. It also changed the ui of my phone after playing, everything is all messed up. Produce games to be played and not a game just for ads.",1
Too many adds.,1
Reviews for a bit more of you to come back in my head and you are so beautiful I hope so I don't know if you don't want you to know that you have a good night baby I just got home from work and I have no idea how much I love you so very much for the day off tomorrow and I'll be home by then I will have to be there in like a plan to go back to the hospital and I have no clue how to get the money for the first time I get off at the end I have no idea what I want you to be a good night baby girl an,1
unplayable because of how much ads it has,1
So bad game if you have alot of people the game make you lose them where the fun in that,1
Done did ten rounds and can't get past 5.4x ? Lmao,1
Tate game Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Mmmmmmmkmmmmmmmmmmm,1
"Forces you to watch an ad (which requires multiple taps to dismiss) after every single round of gameplay. If you can't afford to make an app without bombarding users with ads every 10 seconds, don't make an app.",1
"Expect a double combination cocktail of ¹intrusive ads as well as ²constant ads, during gameplay as well as after every repositioning back to the level start menu. No, tech support, I don't want to try other features or look at other things in the game. There is also a very high chance that you all will likely never change around features that would make this gaming app playable without being interrupted for an ad on a product/app that we'll never purchase. Save time you can't get back!!",1
I like the game,1
Too much advertising,1
"Ads ads ads, it's more ad than game",1
"If it was not for the long commercials after each round, this would be a decent game.",1
Ads! Ads! Ads! and more ADS! Unplayable. Deleted after 3 levels (and 4 ads).,1
Too much anouncments,1
I hate This game,1
"Ad bait shovelware, enjoy your ad money and use it to make a proper game. I just wish I never had to see your ad by Google ad sense again.",1
"Far too many adverts As many reviews have said you'll spend far more time navigating adverts than actually playing. Simple game but not worth downloading. I wish I'd looked at the reviews. Avoid this game, it is a terrible waste of time.",1
So many ads,1
Only add not game time kharab Kiya download karke,1
Super glithy and it moves 3 secs after you tell it this games sucks and alao the stupid ads are so anoying,1
lame game so much ads alot of the levels are just the same every level i finished theres atleast 2 ads and theres alot more things,1
Bakit ganun ďiñawn load ko tapos pagdating ng 80+ nag càncel,1
োেরকক্পচাাা্,1
Awful with very very ads,1
Ads for days makes the game not fun,1
Too many ads,1
"Only playable with no internet, excessive ads",1
Adds pretending to be a game,1
Kept crashing,1
Game feels nice but there are too much ads . Too bad,1
اذا كان نصف نجمة نحطها داير كيما ز#ب$ي 🖕🏽,1
Too many ads! After each level you have to wait a 5 minute long add then you can play the next level. You can't ev6 skip the add. You are forced to watch. That is really sad. I would give -5 start bu I can't. Really sad!,1
"So many adds. And you are forced to watch. Even if you don't opt for the bonus, you still have to watch an add. It's too bad, the game is quite decent.",1
Remove ads or It should be come after 5 to 6 game thats better,1
Too many ads Game is simple and fun but ads make it annoying so I uninstalled it,1
"Would be a fun game if it was playable. The amount of ads in this game is absurd. Not only are they constant, they also interrupt any audio your trying to listen too as well. They really dropped the ball with this pile of garbage.",1
Ads,1
"Play for 10 seconds, ad for 30 and repeat. I can't deal with it. If ads gave rewards and weren't forced at literally every opportunity, I might play this.",1
Too many ads.,1
Boring,1
It keeps stopping,1
"I'm sorry, but this game is boring..after a few games you realize you're just playing the same game over and over. And when you conquer the whole map, NOTHING happens. It just feels a bit like a waste of time.",1
So many ads. Good God. What kind of brain addled idiot would sit through that many advertisements?,1
किहिसिद,1
"Brilliant game but advert after every single level it too much, play a level for 10 seconds followed by a 30 second ad.... Needless to say I have deleted what should be a great game",1
Ads ads ads uninstall 🤣,1
Great if you hate playing games and love watching ads. 10 seconds of gameplay followed by 30 seconds of ads. Rinse. Repeat.,1
"Advert after every level. Doesn't need to be that many adverts, just shows your all about the money ✊💦",1
Hxh,1
Forced ads between each level. Game play is boring as it is similar to the running games. Forced Ads without rewards = instan uninstall and 1 star review,1
"Lol just read the other reviews. Oh and sometimes the ads freeze causing you to close app, then coming back you can't even get the bonus because now the adds are broken. Good stuff.",1
Ads after every single level. No sound in game. Very basic game play.,1
This game is obviously a money grab. I can't earn any of the free skins because I have an ad blocker installed. Why play the game if I can't earn anything unless I watch an ad??,1
BORING. 10 seconds of game play and 30+seconds of ads after EVERY level. Played to level 6 then uninstalled. Totally boring and pointless.,1
Boring,1
Not very difficult,1
"Well DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, you play for 5 seconds and have to watch a 20 seconds add. Waste of time. Do not even bother downloding. Such a WASTE OF TIME. I RATHER GO VIDEOS ONLINE THAN WASTING MY TIME ON MEANINGLESS ADDS YOU GUYS HAVE",1
"You spend more time watching adverts than playing the game. They would've made more money from ads by making the game fun, but this is just too greedy...",1
very bad,1
Ads after every level. You'll literally spend more time watching ads than playing. Toxic devs. Avoid.,1
You run through the gates for 5 seconds and then you have to watch a 1 min ad.,1
Too many ads game could be fun but the creators are too greedy,1
There is more time spent watching ads than playing the game. The interface is trash for just being a left/right swipe game.,1
Far to many ads! After every level! Unistalling,1
I always stuck in 80 bcz of the multiplier is so low and the trap what a funny game 👎,1
There are too many adds. U understand advertising but sheesh... Just let us play the game,1
very nice game but many ads,1
Bonus round ruined everything,1
"The game is unplayable. A banner ad shows at the bottom of the window during the game that causes lag and cannot be closed. I have reached a level where the lag caused by the ad is so bad the game just stops processing anything. The controls suffered from inconsistent input lag even without the banner ad. I tried restarting my phone, I made sure the game was the only app running, I saw no change. The game simply poorly optimized at best.",1
THERE'S ALWAYS AN ADS BEFORE YOU PROCEED TO THE NEXT LEVEL. IT'S VERY ANNOYING!,1
This better bcs not too much ads but still there's ads everytime u finish one level😩 lmao,1
"Controls are bad and a long ad plays every time you finish a run, would not recommend.",1
Good simple game but not worth downloading because of the ads.,1
Too many ads,1
Bad AD. AD shows tap to start but it actually is an installation button.,1
Imagine seeing the same 20 second add after completing every. single. 15 second level.,1
✌✌✌✌✌✌✌,1
To much ad.,1
"I said to myself as soon as I get an ad I'm uninstalling this game, and I got an ad right after the first level of this game.",1
"It's just riddled with ads, it has potential but has an ad every 10/15 seconds after each level, it's is beyond extreme.",1
Ads after every level and it started installing apps onto my phone automatically,1
The ads are longer than the levels!,1
"Too many ads, ads too long, ads unskippable",1
Aggressive ads. Not worth playing.,1
Ok i just started playing and i really want to talk trash about this game at first it was really fun but now almost all the time im on a ad it is realy anoying i do not recmond this game to any one,1
More ads than time playing the game,1
Love the game but there is to many ads uggh at this point I would pay to make the ads go away,1
"Made it to lvl 6 before the automatic ads for ""finishing"" the level just said that's enough",1
Very poor game very laging very bad ads are coming not good for kids .I will recommend it for kids.,1
The game is nice,1
"JUNK! So laggy it's not even fun. I have 100mps and it sucks. Not to mention Ads, Ads and more Ads!",1
Too much ads,1
An absolutely ridiculous amount of ads. 3 in a row after beating a level is just completely milking it,1
Too many adverts,1
Not a bad game but becomes repetitive quickly. Gives you the option to watch an add to multiply your gems yet if you click 'No' it forces you to watch an ad without the option to close it... The low rating is mainly for the ammount of ads and the dishonesty in hos you're forced to watch them.,1
"Its poor quality. and uses among us skins + fall guy skins. When you beat a boss there is a 0 chance of you winning a skin first try, I fought 17 bosses its ment to be a 1 In 3 chance i never won once, but there is an option to go again but you need to watch an ad. I don't know if it's my phone or not but I often find the crowd telaporting it wierd patterns.Far too many ads aswell. So ya pretty bad game. Forgot to add the ad for this game was a fake playable ad so that's pissed me off.",1
More ad,1
Too many ads.,1
Fridge you!!!!!11!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Annoying. Had to turn off wifi and data to ignore all of the annoying ads after. Yes you named it. EVERY LEVEL. No real thought or creativity put into this game. Repatative. ""Ad to win"" Couldn't move far ahead in this very boring game without watching ads.",1
Sir theres a game in your ad,1
Worst app it lagging too much,1
Horrible,1
"Ads everywhere, and the most boring gameplay in the world. Also shows among us as a rare unlock. Among us isn't funny or popular anymore.",1
Mostly ads,1
really laggy and cant adjust to different devices like a chromebook,1
This is bad apps they have so many ads while playing,1
Good game ruined by greedy devs. Ads non stop,1
Never played a game with this many adds. There is more add time than game play,1
Dont like this game,1
🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤕🤕🤕🤢🤮🤮🤮🤒🤮🤒😷🤕🤒🤕🤒🤢😷🤮😷🤮,1
Far too many ads.,1
Its literally just a way to show you ads. Game time is far less than ad time. How do people fall for this,1
Please don't download...Bloody ads👎🏽,1
"Too laggy, i tryed to pass a level and it lagged way of the screen! This game is impossible! i played it all the time months ago but they added all sorts of new updates and reviews are going way downhill i do not recommend this game to anybody who hates #1 lots of ad's #2 laggyness #3 tiny 5 second levels with a, like, 40 second ad after. :(",1
WAY TOO MANY ADS! 10 second level. 2 minutes of ads. Worthless!,1
Boring,1
Sindi Arathi,1
Ads ads ads,1
"Not optimized too laggy, Ads Ads Ads ADS so many great consept poorly executed, Programmers if your reading this develope a similar app game without all of these flaws showing you care and love your game and player base and you'll sore high above this game :)",1
"Lame. ""Earn"" the skin but have to watch an ad. Watch the ad no skin, watch it 2x no skin, decline skin, watch ad. Uninstalled",1
Just a way tobsever you 15 ads per minute,1
"I hope you like ads, because there's more ad content than game content.",1
Over advertisements...not satisfied with this game... After every level there are advertisements,1
each ad flashes and i cant freakiking stop it #anoying this game=poop,1
Avoid Adds every Level,1
Too many ads,1
"Way too many ads, they're everywhere! Not worth the download. You will spend more time watching ads then actually playing",1
WAY to many adds,1
"Too many ads, 30 seconds ads after every level. The ads are long than the levels.",1
"This game is trash, the levels are so short. It's not even fun to play anymore!",1
This game doesn't even fully work right but it will allow you to watch ads perfectly don't waste your time!,1
This game does not deserve in the top because alot of games are better than this,1
When the time spent dealing with ads is more than the time on the games... the game isn't worth it.,1
"The play store page says ""Contains ads"". It should say ""Contains game"" instead. It's just ads, ads, ads ...",1
To many ads..,1
Advertisement after advertisement spend more time on the pay store than on that game,1
"If you like watching ads for more time than you get to play, or if you like the math challenge of choosing is x4 or x5 bigger, this is the game for you!",1
amp,1
Too many ads!,1
It's all ads. Played for 10 min and spent 9 of them watching ads,1
It crashes constantly. You watch a billion ads and it crashes at the end so you don't even get the reward. Not worth the time.,1
The game would be fun but ads after every action make the it unplayable.,1
It's all about the ads!!!!,1
I like it,1
Too many ads. The game is fun but it hangs,1
I think this is the weirdest game ever I played 😝😝 Lots of ads 😡,1
Terable it was so laggy I could barely move my people evan when I started and had no people it would still lag,1
This game is trash. Don't even bother. Overloads you with ads and very boring gameplay. The max multiplier you can get is only x6.2 I managed to get 400 men over the finish line but when you touch the stairs it deletes most of them. STAY CLEAR OF THIS GAME!!!!!,1
Seems like it would have been fun but they ruined it with ads.,1
Boring,1
Add at every level is just stupid it looks like it could Bea fun game but I want to play a game not watch other people play games ...,1
Read some reviews and loaded it. Tried it and found the ad comments are true. Too many of them to make this a decent game. UNINSTALLED,1
The game is good I like it. But spend so much time watching adverts more then playing the game which puts me off. Who wants to watch 30 second of adverts then playing the game which each level lasts 20 seconds,1
Lots of advertisements and will end for 30secs ... lol better not to install this game,1
"Fun to waste some time, dislike ads after every level. Don't like ads to be forced in my face.",1
Demasiados anuncios.,1
Unskippable adds started after second level.,1
"Somewhere in the middle of a ridiculous amount of ads hides a repetitive, buggy, barely challenging ""game"" Don't bother.",1
So many adverts in this game please dont download if you dont like adverts after every level. Should be ashamed.,1
Total commercial propaganda. 7 second game then 60 second ad. Shameless promotional guff. Don't bother with this rubbish,1
Love it so much,1
To repetitive and to many ads,1
😠😠 adds to much yr it's just testing my MB Don't instead this game please guys,1
Easiest game ever....its basically Ads with the most boring gameplay in between.,1
Baaaaaaaàaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad,1
"Play a little. See lots of advertising, then get an advertising demo, then you play a little. Repeat. Absolutely not worth your time. So horrible that I've even deleted the games that were advertised that I used to like.",1
To many adds,1
افتضاح یه ستاره ام زیادشه,1
What is a,1
Waaaay too many ads! Completely takes away the experience of the game.,1
Poor,1

Too many adds,1
Too much adds...waste of time,1
Way too many ads,1
"There is an add after every level, if not a few. Wanted to play a game, not be stuck watching add after add. Do not recommend.",1
THIS IS THE MOST ANOYING ADD EVER AND ITS A REALLY BAD GAME TOO SO SHUT UP WITH YOUR TERRIBLE ADD (I'm nine),1
"the game is good, the more it spoils and the ad you see more ad than you play",1
"Too much bad game , because 100+ I have na so stairs is not coming and biger is coming to fighte its all too much cheating 😖😔👎👎👎👎👎👎👎☝",1
Too many ads. After EVERY level is annoying.,1
Ad after every level,1
Bombards you with ads after every step of obtaining rewards. It's not worth it.,1
💩,1
Way too many ads played for about 5 minutes 😒,1
Very bad,1
Might as well be an advert it's self,1
Too many adds. One every level with no way to pay to remove them. Completely removes the enjoyment and I would not recommend.,1
"More ads than play time, what a shame.",1
"ads, ads, ads...",1
Too many ads,1
"As usual with mobile games nowadays, you can't get past the first level without encountering an unskippable ad around 40-50 seconds. Funny as the levels aren't even as long as the ads, can't burn time nor can you play the levels to enjoy the game, even if it was enjoyable.",1
"My god played till level 7 that was enough, after every level 30 second ad.",1
Utter waste ....,1
WAY too many ads! Uninstalled.,1
"Like everyone says, more ads than game. I uninstalled after 3 levels. Literally an ad after ever level.",1
Decently entertaining game but impossible to play with all the ads. Uninstalled,1
"Ads,ads,ads not a game with ads, ads with a game",1
Honestly very unoriginal and the amount of lag was insane it was unplayable,1
Mid,1
L game bozos🤡👎🏽,1
Fun game but DAMN! way to many ads!!,1
Basic game designed to farm ad revenue from the player,1
Absolutely trash,1
I hate it🤬🤬🤬,1
"Absolute trash. Play for ten seconds and watch a thirty second ad. Play ten more seconds, watch another ad. Wash rinse and repeat.",1
You suck,1
Fun concept but way too many ads. There are ads after every level and between many actions.,1
there's ads after every round,1
If you try to turn off your WIFI it doesn't EVEN WORK ADS ADS ADS EVERYWHERE ITS ANNOYING PLEASE JUST DONT DO THIS NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME ITS NOT FUN AND YOU'LL GET BORED WITHEN 3 LEVELS ITS NOT FUN AT ALL THE ADS JUST COME EVEN IF YOU WIFI IS OFF BAD GAME WORST GAME DO NOT PLAY😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😤😾💥,1
Ads are needed for survival but frequency should be controlled.,1
Ad after ad after ad after ad....,1
Very nice game,1
Ads ads ads ads and more ads,1
"This app is not worth it after let's give it 5 games. It's honestly not the advertising even though there's a huge amount of it, it's the fact that you're going nowhere and it doesn't seem like there's an end goal Plus when you reach the steps it doesn't allow you to get past 6.5 what's the point if I can't even try to get past where I am currently ending up at it's a waste of time and it's very boring don't even download it at this point. This is the first app that I said that about, just NO!",1
Was pretty fun but ad after every run (more time on ads than play),1
I don't love it,1
This is so good game,1
47 seconds of ads followed by 25 seconds of game play. Ads in between every level. Uninstalled after a short session of playing it. Too many ads.,1
It's easy,1
Ad delivery app,1
The game has too many ads you cant enjoy the game because every time you finish a level theres always a add.,1
"Julle ads is poes, julle game is poes! Tsek met die stuk naai hier.",1
"Too easy, looks very cheap ans repetative",1
I dont like this game because it getting so many ads my mobile data is wasting it . I think you may give few ads for this game. I am uninstalling this game,1
This mental game is the worst it doesn't open in Lenovo mobile and tab,1
Ad after EVERY SINGLE SCREEN. And you cant skip them.,1
واقعا خیلی حصله سر بره,1
TOO MUCH ADS CAN'T PLAY PEACEFULLY,1
Ads. Way to many.,1
"The first 4 levels were fine, then had to recharge my phone, I tried to play, loaded and that was it, a blank screen, no matter what I tried, nothing, nerds. Uninstall it. Will not try it again.",1
too many ads,1
There arq way to many ads which does not make it enjoyable. I downloaded it and it was entertaining but I spent more ti. E watching ads than a level actually lasts. There is no need for an ad after every single level. It's ridiculous.,1
"Too many ads, more than playtime.",1
I enjoy the game but the amount of ads is ridiculous. Uninstalled 20 mins after I downloaded.,1
Terrible. Too many ads!!!,1
I hAtE iT,1
"Very laggy, way too much ads and not even fun or educational",1
Downloaded. Played a couple of times. An advert to sit through after every single round. Deleted.,1
Designed to just be a quick game to show you ads every 30 seconds,1
"Terribly glitchy, settings not immediately available, and absolutely smothered in ads. Don't waste your time.",1
"Worked through the map, which was short in itself, then it freezes every time an add opens.",1
I'm not even kidding when I say that this game took THREE HOURS to LOAD. And it me five minutes to move the tiniest bit! This is the worst game I have EVER PLAYED.,1
Don't even think about it Unplayable (ads)),1
Would be a 4 or 5 EASILY without all the ads. Why am I spending more time watching ads than actually playing the game?,1
"Ads every 30 seconds, unplayable",1
Because of so many ads in this game and this game hang my mobile,1
Even less fun than it looks.,1
Ads. Just way too many ads. I'd almost be okay with it if it didn't feel like ads with a game built around them,1
The worst ads,1
Nice,1
CONSTANT ADS REALLY FRUSTRATING,1
Never play thus game its too simple and has too many ads so plz delete the game from your phone fast,1
"Horrible! Do not download, said the other reviews. I didn't listen because I liked the concept. I should've listened. This app is a revenue farm. 30 second adds after a 20 second level",1
"Cold garbage. Don't download. !!!!!! Straight commercial. No value of consumer. Product has good themes but u won't be able to play. Ada Ada Ada Ada Ada. 30 second levels, 1 minute ad. ZERO STARS!!!",1
So many ads.,1
alot of ads sial,1
So many ads in between games.. So irritating. I just played 2 rounds and i'm gonna uninstall this... Ads in between rounds is so irritating. It would have been more better if it was after the round,1
Shity game with full of shity ads,1
All is advertising and little game,1
Too many ads! Between every short level.,1
dont waste your time game lags and freezes,1
Too many ads like always 🙄 and I experience some laggy parts where I can't even control them midgets DO NOT GET ITS BIG L FOR ME 👎,1
"Its a really bad game, its always stopping , shaking in the middle of the game",1
和他的猫咪老师👌,1
There is an insane amount of ads it's borderline unplayable,1
The ads are more entertaining than the gameplay,1
WAY to many add,1
Too much ads. It's unusable,1
Ad machine,1
"Pointless, repetitive levels and way too many ads.",1
It has to many adds,1
To many commercials. Round lasts about 10 seconds and there is a commercial. The commercials last longer than the round. Uninstalling now.,1
To many ads... not a fun game,1
Too many ads disturbs the whole gaming experience.,1
Hello you must just off your WiFi for the ads then they wont be ads,1
Not much to describe.... Ad platform. Enough said,1
Not possible to play .... Ads ads ads ... More ads .. and thn a lil bit more ads and grand finale: ads ads ads ads ads ads... Fcuk you with your ads,1
"Roughly 20 seconds to complete very repetitive levels, then an advert often lasting longer than the level itself. Like so many games, it exists as a platform for advertising and nothing more. Go and watch paint dry it's probably a more productive (and entertaining) use of your time.",1
"Concept is cool. 10 sec level followed by 30 second Ad, every time. Shameful!",1
"Katastrofa.....instalirao sam igricu da bih je igrao, a ne da gledam 90% vremena reklame!!!",1
Way too many ads!!!! Makes the game terrible! Everything you do or click gives you a AD!! Bad game don't play.,1
Like everyone else says... its a fun little game and pretty much what youd expect from the promos---but just waaaay too many ads. I've also had the pleasure of being in a never ending loop of ad watching just trying to get to next level-- I ended up just exiting. Four times in a row after playing only a dozen times or so - its a hard DON'T BOTHER from me! bye bye bad app.,1
It lags and to many ads not worth downloading,1
60% adds maybe more than that,1
I don't normally review games but after seeing so many ads for this thought I'd try it. Its not a game its an ad. Every single run has an ad after it. Every one. Don't waste your time on this,1
Panna parata game very bad,1
Ads,1
Advert after advert after advert after advert constant bombardment,1
">Watch ad for reward? -Nah. >Okay, here's an ad for no reward! That's all you need to know",1
"Nothing but ads, so don't waste your time. As someone else stated, you can just turn off your wifi and data. However, why would I do that just so I can try to enjoy an obviously sub-par game that is made to generate nothing but ad revenue by bombarding you with ads after every 30 second round.",1
Ad-simulator,1
Freeking ads Going to uninstall,1
Awful. Literally 10 seconds of play and then a 60 second ad. Unplayable.,1
Ad after ad after ad...,1
"Reklameeeeee, reklameeeee...",1
Too many ads,1
For every 15 seconds of game There is 30 seconds of ads,1
The game is easy enough but the amount of ads is crazy and they last longer than the levels your playing.,1
Pakav game,1
"Fun game but too many add. You spend double the yikes waiting until adds finish that actually playing. I have deleted the game, although I did enjoy it.",1
"Too many ads, fun for a while then gets boring",1
"Ads, games, ads,ads, ads, game, ads,ads,ads,ads.little game lots of ad time",1
Ads take longer than gameplay,1
Too many ads .. u paly onle 10 sec and watch the afs for 30 sec,1
Omg do not get this it has way to many adds I can not handle it!!,1
Ads are ridiculous!,1
So many advertisements you can't play the game,1
Spend more time in ads than in the short and boring levels. Pass.,1
Long ads after every level avoid,1
"Ads, ads, ads, ads do not download.",1
Too too many commercials.,1
This game is very nice For Counting,1
Too many ads,1
Count adds master more adds than gameplay,1
Ads are longer than the rounds. Game could be a fun time killer but the ads completely ruin it. You'll only play once for less than 5 minutes.,1
✋🏻👎🏻,1
Each level lasts about 20 seconds then you have to watch a minutes worth of ads after each one. Ridiculous,1
i hait this busterd game with busterd ads:((,1
Tatiy,1
Ad after every level is too much!!! Fun game but too many ads!!!,1
It lag when I get a lot of people.,1
The most amazing worst game ive ever seen,1
Way too many ads,1
"Najgorsze ścierwo spamu, reklam. Gierka oraz jej reklama nadają się na dno śmietnika.",1
Please don't play this game. This a...holes are taking my data by promoting other games.f...k you.,1
I dont like this game irs SUPER glichy when they go over the ramp they just all just die its just a waste of storage,1
Ridiculous number of extremely long ads. Not worth the download.,1
Uninstalled after only playing two turns. There are ads at the bottom of the screen in game and lengthy ads after each turn.,1
just no too much ads I hate ads in any game,1
WAYYYYYY TO MANY AD'S don't waste your time.,1
"Why I gave this game 1 star? BECAUSE Everytime when I win it always Gets An Ad. This Game is Horrible, Count Master Developers, Make This Game Better.",1
"Repetitive, ad spamming joke of a game",1
Literally every level there is an ad. Come on youre making money regardless don't make the game just dumb because of ads alone.,1
What a load of crock. 5 times as much of your phone being hijacked by adverts than playing the game. Don't Bother.,1
"Life-hack for all those frustrated by bombardment of Ads: play with your wifi/data disconnected. In doing so you initially discover this to be quite an addictive game, which becomes less so as you go on playing. Mindlessly repetitive, after several levels you unlock a conquer-the-map style base-building minigame fuelled by diamonds you're rewarded in exchange for watching endless advertisements, or doled out in 30-per-10 level increments. Eventually, you just give up, it goes nowhere. Poo.",1
Not interested coz very much ads,1
Ad every 20 seconds of gameplay.,1
Worst game ever,1
"10 seconds game play, followed by 30 seconds of adverts.... And repeat. Deleted after 3 levels",1
Waaaay too many ads. It's a simple enough game but the ads ruin the enjoyment of playing because your spending over half your time watching suggested other games.,1
It's terrible,1
It's was so Loggy every bonus part of the game it's logs and every game has ads,1
Fun game. Levels last like 15 seconds. And there's an ad after every... Freaking.... Level... Uninstalled after the first 3 levels.,1
"There are way too many ads. You get a 30 second ad after each round which only lasts like 15 seconds. It sucks because this game definitely has potential. Remove the ads after each round or lessen them to maybe every few rounds then maybe you might be ok but unfortunately, I will be uninstalling it.",1
"Hell of ads, dont download this gold digger game",1
No a good game it represents its self every game and is boring don't get this game,1
اعلاناتكم مقرفه,1
"Dumb and an ad or two at every single level... 10s play, 30 to 60s ads... Greedy developers, bad game.",1
ads...,1
No path to move on an so many adverts there are Christmas adverts still on this there are about a zillion adverts for highly discredited play for pay apps and they all take longer than a level. The bits of yhe game don't seem to interact properly so runner build and attack phases hold no real cohesion and after you've completed the US an built up your little kingdom there's no more to that it seems. There's no real incentive to spend coins and level up you can beat everything without it,1
i think i broke it xD,1
Just a game for ads,1
Games of this level of quality do not warrant an ad after every level,1
Good,1
"Too many ads, and it is generally pretty boring",1
Too many ADs,1
Unskippable adds after every level. Each add has 2 or more different phases to X out of.,1
There's an ad after every single level. Waste of time tbh,1
"I played for 10 seconds, then it crashed my device, this game SUCKS, i do NOT recomend",1
Threre is a lor of ads i really dont like this cuz after every round u played there is an ad it is really annoying,1
Fooking shite,1
More ads than game,1
App was deleted right when the first advert prevented me from using it.,1
Bad game ruined my chromebook,1
Pretty poorly made and not that fun.,1
Fastdonet,1
Nothing in this game,1
"A fun and novel way to make me watch ads. Game play lasts 45 seconds, which is immediately followed by multilayer ads. Uninstalled immediately",1
Soooo many ads,1
Too many damn ads. Extremely annoying game,1
Too many adds!!!!,1
Ridiculous amount of ads.,1
Rubbish. An ad after each level? Waste of my time!,1
can't be asked to look at forced ads after every level,1

Ad simulator,1
Played for 20 seconds before hit with an ad. Uninstalled.,1
"Fun game, well done to developers. But!! Proper piss poor on the ads, there's 2 every 10 seconds. Don't bother!",1
Fix the ad problems as b annoying,1
I wanna play. But it just a dumb app,1
7 ads for 1 level lmao...,1
Too many ads,1
Good but no the best,1
Too many ads. Ruins the gameplay. Uninstalled after few minutes. Would not recommend for installation.,1
Absolute rape with how many ads it forces on you.,1
Too many ads.,1

Annoying ads,1
Too many ads. Much too simplistic gameplay.,1
"Тормозит, лагает, реклама ради рекламы",1
"It could be so much longer! I would prefer if it was more challenging. So many ads😡😡😤it is bad and the characters look like no one put anyneffort into them. please, just design the figurs more!! And it is very boring, too easy to win. Easy and short, too many ads. Deserves half a star.",1
Ads the ads are every where,1
"Not a game, instead it's an ad watching app... So many ads there is no game.",1
manner,1
Cool game but as soon as you start playing the game the advertsments just keep pops up every 5 seconds you are unable to play so i have to uninstole it. Because you spend more time watching adds then playing the game. YOU SHOULD REDUCE THE ADD TO AT LEAST EVERY 3 TO 4 LEVELS NOT EVERY 5 SECONDS I ALOMST BROKE MY PHONE BECAUSE OF THAT LOL. I MUST DELITE THIS GAME SHAME COZ ITS A COOL GAME:(,1
"PARANG GAGO LANG. PURO ADS, PURO LAG, WALANG KWENTA, NAKAKABWISET LANG.",1
Way too many ads,1
"Never got difficult, super easy, tons of ads.",1
No mater how hard you try you will always end up with the same results. Sometimes seeing this i do agree with THANOS,1
Way too many ads!,1
Why are these games so popular? So many ads and terrible gameplay. They literally pump these things out as money grabs.,1
"Too many ads, so annoying",1
I hate this,1
Ads,1
Just a quick way to grab ad revenue from gullible children Don't know why this is even legal,1
Boring game full of ads,1
Adds adds and adds,1
Awful game. Caused me to have an exticential crisis in only one hour of gameplay. If I had a time machine I would go back in time and kill myself before I could play this game. I woild rather eat a muffin full of beatles before I touched this game again. Talking to my ex is more enjoyable then playing this game. All in all 200/10 Among us reference funE,1
Shadab,1
Only build for ads,1
"Game lasts 10 seconds, ad lasts 30 seconds after every game. Dont get it",1
Poopy,1
"You play literally for 5 seconds, the level completes and then you have to endure a 30 second ad, and you have to click on the cross thrice to get rid of it... Seriously??? Uninstall...",1
"Don't download, there are ads every single second",1
"I understand that ads pay for the game, but the amount of these d@mn ads played are way too much...makes the game unenjoyable.",1
Ads ads ads,1
Ads ads ads only ads.,1
BAD IT WON'T LET ME PLAY I'M SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD GRRR,1
"You spend more time watching ads tgan playing the game. And when do actually play, you usually cant even get enough points to get the max multiplier. You dont have enough room to move when you have ""avoidable"" obstacles if you have a good amount of men.",1
"Simple game, but has more ads than play time. Ads at the bottom in either mode, ads in between levels, ads to increase your characters, ads to increase chance of winning gems or coins, ads to be in there just because. With the inclusion of so many ads it drains battery life quite a bit. Just two levels with all the ads takes 3% of battery. No way to redeem gems after a few levels in the secondary game, just getting more gems, and watching more ads.",1
Ads ads adssssssss,1
You spend more time waiting for the X to appear to skip over all the ADS than playing the actual game. I uninstalled after the 4th level I got so tired of all the ads. Don't waste your time or bandwidth!,1
"A level in this game is around 15 seconds long, you get an ad after every level. That's a minimum of 25% (assuming you skip straight after 5 seconds) of the game being just ads. Don't bother look for literally anything else",1
countmasterseplc,1
Horrible,1
Good,1
Worst game for ads I have EVER tried. 1 ad per level.,1
The ad for this game is very annoying and I honestly don't know why you'd put in more ads than gameplay,1
Tatti ha ye,1
"Full of ads, you watch ads more than you play.",1
Wouldn't recommend it ...the ads included is long time crazy.....zero star,1
Too many ads,1
Ad delivery system.lvls are around 10 seconds followed by 30 second ad,1
App's only use is to watch ads and create revenue for the dev(s). I have watched more forced ads than levels played. 1 star.,1
Play this in offline.,1
Ad spamware,1
Keeps freezing,1
To much ads,1
Vansh,1
"Insane amount of ads. Each level takes about 10 seconds to beat, followed by a 30-second ad...minimum!! Terrible",1
West west wrst west game in life,1
This is not a game this is an ad service disguised as a game.,1
😒😑😠😠👎,1
Could be fun if you didn't have commercials. Deleted 15 minutes after I started playing.,1
Three ads in the first and last 30 seconds I played.,1
"Good game, helps your brain and reflexes. However like everything now. Most games, Facebook, YouTube, TV... You spend more time watching adverts!!!! I appreciate that it is free but why should I play a game that takes 5 seconds to complete a level and then spend 60 seconds watching adverts!!! Oh and after every level... Really...",1
ADS EACH LEVEL. NO FUN.NO THRILL,1
More time spent in ads than playing the game and they are really disruptive to the gameplay,1
Game glitches before it opens,1
You got a game in your ads.,1
So much ads,1
"Good game, good concept, but the ads ruin the fun. Uninstalled.",1
It's too bad,1
"Terrible, way to laggy and way to many ads",1
Nice super,1
"Wont even download. From all of the other reviews, i can see that there is way too many ads. Dont even bother downloading this game.",1
Horrible... Can't play a single game without an ad after,1
Too many adds,1
"I agree with all of these 1 star add comments wish i could give it none to be honest. It's just annoying to deal with all of these ads. I even turned my wifi off. Literally played it for about 5 mins and got bored of the short, repeated rounds and deleated it. Just an add trap.",1
Play 11 seconds 30 second add. Play 11 second 30 second add. Dont bother downloading.,1
Too many ads,1
Vinit kumar,1
Wow boring.,1
I'm so sick of these games that litter the games with ads after every single play. Enough already.,1
Total trash you watch about a minute of ads for 30 seconds of play this is spamware not a game,1
Mindless games are sometimes entertaining but ad riddled.,1
Very bad game like poti,1
my phone literally crashed lol,1
The fun lasted for maybe 5 minutes after downloading. Too many ads and the game isn't challenging. I shouldn't fly through the levels with little to no differences between each level. You can play it with your eyes closed. Uninstalled.,1
Boring and easier than it should be. All the levels are the same. No new ideas,1
Game made for a quick buck. Should be renamed Ad Simulator.,1
"Nice game but amount of ads is horrible. After every level you have to watch ad, after everything you have to watch ad. I know purchasing would remove ads but that is not excuse developers should be using.",1
Hey I dont like this ads right now That When you finish a level you had ads. I cant even play when you finish a level. Even when you are wifi. The ads shows you. When its offline its not. But there reason if you do offline you cant do anything upgrade city walls or even your skins SHAME ON YOU DEVS. Money grab. Guys dont Install this. Do rate 1 in your game RIGHT NOW. ADS ARE DISGUSTING AND MORE HORRIBLE ADS HAHAHAHA LOLS,1
Ad,1
It is a very poor game and very add game,1
"20 sec gaming, 40 sec ads 🤮",1
My favrtm,1
This is not a game. It is simply a way to force you to watch adds. Do not download.,1
This game is really bad.,1
"Great app if you enjoy ads. However, I downloaded it to play a game.",1
Boring,1
Ads ads ads ads,1
The game is boring and its only good for the first ten games its boring has no challenging stuff and I think it rubbish.,1
Too much ads can't even play without one ad,1
Garbage,1
"Game play was fun enough, but the ads between levels were way too long. Insta-uninstall I'm afraid.",1
Do not even try to download this game I spent more time watching forced ads than actual playing,1
Ads ads ads and more ads. Thats the game.,1
too many ads,1
So many adds makes this game so boring I really didn't like it..I uninstalled,1
mostly ads,1
"There's an add, there's an add there's an add add add, then watch all of them freeze up and watch them all over again. Nope delete!",1
This game is a bit fun but the main problem is ads when you beat a level there is a 100% chance you get an ad and those levels are 10-20 seconds long and those ads are 15-30 seconds long. You would be watching more ads than playing,1
The game is bad. It is very bad.,1
Never change same thing over and over.,1
The amount of app is ridiculous. Makes the whole game completely rubbish,1
To many ads and the game crashes and goes to a black screen when trying to come back to the game from some of the ads.,1
Too too many adds,1
To many ads,1
Booooring!,1
Ad machine. Not even spaced out enough to enjoy it. Horrible experience and frustrating,1
Too manny ads after playing for only fifteen min it had over 15 ads thats one every min,1
Way to many ads. Every level watch an ads want to upgrade watch an ad Tasks away all the fun. L,1
Ads. Too much ads. Also repetitive and boring.,1
The worst game i ever played anytime ad and i hate this game,1
"Way too many adverts FML, they just get in the way every damned time I hate when there's so much advertising. Detracts from the gameplay. Don't bother",1
Too mant ads,1
The basic game is fun and pretty elegant. I'm not sure how well it progresses in difficulty since I didn't get very far. The reason I didn't get very far? The amount of ads shown was way over the top.,1
Far too many adverts,1
Missions are 8-15seconds long with an ad every single one. What happened to an ad every 10-15min.,1
Boring don't download it's not fun it's not a game,1
nice ads,1
"Idea is nice. Execution is terrible. Saw it as an ad, downloaded, played for 30 minutes, uninstalled it, and probably have some sort of virus.",1
Super game,1
You spend more time forced to watch ads than you do playing.,1
"Absolutely bloated with advertising! Ten seconds of play, 30 seconds of ads. Earn a reward? Watch another ad to receive it. Played for ten minutes and deleted it. Avoid unless you have endless patience.",1
Lord the ads is so annoying every game there is an ad you cannot enjoy the game if your internet is turned on,1
Haven't played it yet,1
Optimizasyon sorunu var(350 kişide ) ve fazla asker olunca istemesende tuzaklara yarısı ölüyor,1
Lol u have to watch ads left and right,1
Ads are terrible. Good luck actually playing.,1
"Lots of ads between levels, poor control aso...uninstall",1
RoWDY,1
"Only game where you have to watch an ad to finish a bonus level, then watch an ad to get awarded the bonus item, then watch an ad to use the bonus item... spend 5 times more time watching ads then playing the game!",1
Too many ads. Basic game.,1
very ads,1
To many ads,1
"Really boring and stages almost are the same and made me tires,because of that I unistalled this game😐",1
Adds are longer than the game play.,1
"After reading all the other reviews, I decided to turn off my WiFi and see how the game is without ads. Turns out there's barely anything to do in it, you get introduced to very basic mechanics of avoiding obstacles which reduce your number of units and choosing the multiplier that you want. All the skins get be obtained in less than an hour of playtime, after that you get to boringly bring your team to the end of the level until you upgrade all two modifiers.. Definite uninstalled game. Don't",1
"Too many ads vs actual game time. Also, ads don't close when expected, instead the ""x"" actually opens install option for ad.",1
Ads ads ads,1
Wast oda,1
Too many ads and wayyyy to repetitive! Don't play it sucks,1
"Ads, ads, ads, and then more ads at every possible time. Uninstalling now.",1
It's good,1
Tooo many ads 😑,1
"Can't even play offline because every time you collect a reward, it freezes because you have no choice but to load an ad. Not even worth the time it takes to download",1
Too many ads,1
This game is really glitchy...the main point of the game is pretty cute and interesting but has too many bugs to enjoy it.,1
ads na may konting laro,1
To many ads.,1
suuuuuuuuuuupidddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd,1
"Too many ads, levels are too short",1
"1 game, 1 ad, 1 game, 1 ad, etc. Deleted after 10 min",1
Terrible game! The ad is longer than the game itself! 🚮🚮🚮,1
Ads after level of play plus ads to increase other levels such as income. You should rename the game to Ad Count Masters. Not fun to have so many ads so frequently. Uninstalled after about three or four levels. Not worth my time to watch ads all day.,1
"Your excessive ads only makes hate the product I'm obliged to see and the app I'm using plus the company that distribute them, FU and bye!",1
"If you're into watching ads more than playing a game, this is your game. For every 5 second level, you're going to watch about 30 seconds of ads. Could be fun based on mechanics but the tediousness of watching ads is not my thing. I'm ok with ads, but maybe give us a few levels between ads rather than every single one.",1
Ads take up more time than actual gameplay.,1
Just a bad minigame. Boring and reminds me of the bad browser flash games,1
Ads. Every. Single. Game.,1
Way too many ads.... Period,1
One ad per round. Outrageous.,1
Not good,1
Cant even install in perfect internet,1
"Way too many ads, I can understand that the debs need to make money but at times there seems to be more ads than actual game play. Complete waste of time unless you have an ad block",1
"10 seconds level, 30 second ad. Rinse, repeat. Avoid if possible, less of a game and more an ad delivery service.",1
"This game is stupid,each time you win it all way shows ads every bloody time.",1
"Don't bother. There's a time locked ad after every level, and each level lasts about 10 seconds. It's more ad than game. Fun concept, but not enjoyable the way it is.",1
"Unbelievable amounts of ads. Every single button you press gives a 30 second ad. Also, the game is super boring super quickly haha.",1
Levels last maybe 5 or 10 seconds then there's a 1 minute ad. Not worth it.,1
Ad ad ad,1
Ads after every option,1
"The pick 3 is rigged, makes you watch two ads to unlock a character with the thought That you had a choice.",1
"Очередная рекламная помойка, интересно, как поживает разработчик",1
Immediately hit with an ad after the tutorial lol these games are getting ridiculous. The free time I have I don't want to play games that have more ads than content to play,1
Too much adds,1
To many ads,1
"Understand they need ads but this has WAY too many, constantly. Ridiculously non-entertaining.",1
"When the mandatory ads are longer than the levels, you know it's a bad game.",1
"The game itself is ok, but I spent more time watching ads than playing. Uninstall. I understand the need for ads, but the game round is shorter than the ads that follow it!",1
Typically full of adverts. Stupid adverts after every level. Waste of time game. Not worth the time downloading it or even to play it.,1
Unplayable because of the commercials,1
To many adds🤣🤦🏽‍♀️,1
Absolutely wastage of time..,1
To remove the next 3rd nutty ro. Not .but the 7-Eleven will he'll pick,1
Terrible. There's an ad ever 20 second or so. And it's just as stupidly easy as it looks in the ads they put out.,1
Too many ads,1
Ad Scam It doesn't even quite finish scoring before the ad begins after EVERY round. Rewards are not given at the end of levels unless you watch a 30 second ad.,1
Good game,1
Really fun game but the ads omg no fun Anny more to play,1
The game is so glitchy i cant do anything in it i try and i keep loosing because it loads while i try and move the ads are so long i hate it,1
Too many ad,1
Probably the worst game I have ever played for adverts a level lasts seconds then you get an ad. Pure greed not worth time downloading!,1
Good,1
I spend more time watching ads than playing the levels,1
to many ads,1
This game is cheeting game 👿👿,1
"Games is ok, but you spend more time in ads than you do the game",1
Ads with a game to play in between.,1
"What a waste of time. If I could give zero stars I would. A level takes about 4 seconds to beat, then you have to watch a 15 second+ commercial. Collect bonuses after finishing enough levels, 30 second commercial. Cancel the commercial to abandon the bonus, 15 second commercial. WASTE OF TIME!!!",1
"Absolute rubbish. Ad after every single run, some of them you cannot even quit.",1
Pretty entertaining for an ad simulator. If only the levels would last longer than the forced delay of the skip button for in-game ads,1
Too many ads,1
The game is insanely pointless..the best player is the one that has time to spend on ads..90% ads..you could even get your team maxed out without even completing a single level,1
Worst game ever. Thats all i can say,1
"Lagging, only aimed to make you watch ads😠",1
Far too many ads.,1
"""Count Masters"" if I named it I would call it Lag Masters, every time I try to play it lags and freeze up and makes me fall and loose, would not recommend 😕",1
So much ads,1
STUPID DEVELOPER,1
"98% ads. Very tiresome, don't bother.",1
"Doesn't let me exit the reward screen (click one thing and watch an add if you want for another) had to exit game, 2nd play gave me an add. Game ruined",1
Almost can't play the game because too many ads. Non-stop ads.,1
Too many adds,1
This game is terrible. Collect coins and diamonds and for what? You can't do anything with them. I've completed the build section and unlocked all the avatars and have thousands of diamonds but nothing to spend them on. Literally half a game with ads every 20seconds. Just an ad farm to get advertising cash.,1
"The ads are too much. I'm a patient person, and I understand the need for ads, but this is too much. Uninstalling this game now.",1
"I liked the idea but the game was SO glitchy, i had to close the game at every boss fight. The boss would keep running at my troops while they would attack him and it would just get stuck there.",1
More time with ads than playing game. Game not challenging either.,1
Trash,1
"Very very very annoying game, because you will get ads from the very 1st step, and you cannot skip them.",1
Too much pubs,1
Mom: hey da- Daughter:HELP ME FROM THIS GAME anyways I do not like this game- ads every 10 seconds,1
I'd love to play the game. The two minute ads every minute is killing your ap people.,1
"Ads can be skipped after 5-10 seconds but unfortunately levels are really short meaning game vs. Ad watching really destroys any enjoyment of the game. I would have thought user longevity would have given the publisher more ad revenue rather than the current install, annoy user and uninstall method",1
Is the worst game ever,1
"For every 15 seconds you play, you have to watch 2 minutes of adds. Not worth your time.",1
Such a nasty app.... Only adds,1
"This is no game, you are forced to watch an ad every so often, it also burns your battery because of the constant checking. Lastly the ads are on your own device which endangers your device to malware",1
Full of ads,1
Ads every 30 seconds? That's a bit much. I spent more time watching ads than I did playing.,1
Worst game ment for only ads,1
An ad every level wth is that,1
Always lag,1
Countless adds,1
ADS,1
thanks for the update showing up reminding me to uninstall,1
"Bad bad bad bad Why? Because: 200b advertisements, you yes you You will delete and get mad Please fix this game right now!",1
Absolute garbage. Nothing but Ads. AVOID THIS APP AT ALL COSTS!,1
Too many ads,1
Never thought it could get worse but there's more ads than game time on this one. Not challenging enough to justify watching multiple ads in one minute,1
Great app! Love that I get to play a game between ads ... (That's sarcasm - so.many.ads.),1
Too many adds,1
I played for 5 minutes and had 4 minutes of ADs. Not an enjoyable experience,1
"Fun game, but it is far too filled with ads. Every lvl you get an ad.",1
Ads are so bad.,1
Dont get the game ts a wasit of time it started to lag wen i was playing and their is alot of ads.(bad spelling when reading this.),1
Decent game but WAY TOOOOO MANY adverts... Spend more time on pointless advertising videos rather than being able to play the actual game!,1
This game is the best,1
Anji,1
Boring,1
Ads after every level. Very annoying and therefore not playable.,1
To many ads,1
Booooow,1

Too many ads! There was an ad before I even got to play a single game! 😤😤😤,1
Worst game . When I upgrade I get more score but it's strucking I think we cannot reach till end . Don't play this game such a worst game .such a useless game it always disappoints me when I reach near to 400 it will be stopped .don't install it waste game..............,1
Cool game but the amount of ads make it literally annoying. Way way too many ads. Such a pity for a cool game,1
"Sooooooo many freaking ads. Every level you beat, 3 ads!!! Every button you press, another freaking ad!!! Ridiculous!!",1
"Ads, ads, and more ads.",1
"Gameplay stutters making it very difficult and you have to watch an ad after EVERYTHING you do. The runs last 10-15 seconds but there's an ad after, also another ad if you want to boost gems. ITS JUST CONSTANT ADS!!!!!!!!!!!",1
If you love watching numerous long ads and hate playing games this game is for you,1
Ads like crazy after every boring level,1
It is not a fun thing to do,1
"Ads, ads, ads...",1
"Ur smelly. Ur game is also smelly. Please remove from google play and move elsewhere. We do not want you here, blocking up our games. I speak on behalf of very many people, go away. I dont like u. Also, ur ads take up more time than the game itself. U r just frauds. Go elsewhere. Goodbye.",1
typical,1
Money making ad machine. Ruined it!,1
Bad game,1
waaaaay too many ads and it's not worth buying,1
Íts always laging and a lot òf ádds,1
Good luck with it,1
Bawasir,1
"Gameplay is far too fast and simple. Wouldnt be so bad but every single level ends with you watching ads for longer than you were playing. Half the ads are for other versions of this game, the same thing but a different theme.",1
Idk why i ship them,1
Tooo many ads can't play comfortably,1
Too many ads.,1
"If I could give zero stars, I would. What kind of game like this throws up ads in the middle of the game when you need to move quickly! Absolute stupidity. Installed and uninstalled in less than 5 mins. What a waste!",1

App sucks. TOO MANY ADS. Ads are too long. More ads then game. Great concept horrible execution.,1
"Levels last maybe thirty seconds and then there are ads after every level (seriously, every single level without fail).",1
Don't download this app !!!!!,1
It should be illegal to have this many ads. Fun game ruined,1
Way too easy and just a mediocre money grab,1

"All ads. No game. Just pure, unskippable ads. Every 2 seconds of game is 25 seconds in ads. Do not install this commercial of a game",1
"Ads ads ads, 10 sec levels, more ads ads ads. Not worth the time",1
Too many ads,1
i dont like this game it wont let me download it uncool,1
Too many ads and the game is so slow. You spend more time waiting for the game to catch up than you do playing the game,1

So much fun I like😍😍😍 very much,1
So many ads. Crazy... Unplayable..,1
"Ads ads ads! If you love just watching ads, download this game right now.",1
Another ad delivy service with a glitchy game stuck to it. It appears to have been designed by cynical corporate aliens whos only reference of what humans enjoy is search engine results and trends. In order to make a good game you need better motivation than selling adspace.,1
Honestly don't bother even for a time waster it's add bombs you whenever it has the chance with no neat or cool unique features/mechanics just boring after 5 minutes.,1
"Laggy, glitchy, trash fr.",1
Soooooo... Many ... Aaaaadds..... Not worth it. Ran about 5 lvls and uninstalled.,1
Great fun fame but ridiculous amount of ads. Deleted after 5 mins,1
"Way too many ads. I'm ok with ads, but this was an absurd amount. Within 20 minutes I watched 15 minutes of ads.",1
After 10 sec playing I get commercial This is just horrible,1
Too much ad so don't bother,1
So many ads...,1
Too many ads cant forward until almost at the end.... Uninstalled after beating boss,1
no way to use again,1
Why is there an add after every level?,1
Too many ads,1
"Too many ads, uninstalled",1
"This is not a game but an ad player. Yeah it is in the game category, so between ads you can play shortly. If you are not a big fun of watching ads, i don't recommend this.",1
More ads than game,1
"Full of ads, uninstalled it",1
Enjoy Advertising? You will love this game.,1
Boring,1
Too many ads,1
Tooo mamy ads,1
The time spent watching the ads exceeded by far the actual time I spent playing.,1
There are tooooo much ads and I can't even play the game right because of the ads and it glitches too much,1
This is not a game with ads it's ads with a game. 10 seconds of play for 30 seconds of advertising Ridiculous I give it a big -5 on a 1 to 10 scale,1
Im uninstalling this after 2 minutes of playing. This is fun but it has ads in every completed level. you can complete the game fast. Im watching ads more than playing psh,1

By far the most boring pointless game I've ever played. It takes no skill and there is no challenge. Just seems like the bare minimum to pump out as many ads as possible.,1
"Way too many ads, makes it no fun to play and uninstalled.",1
Vanshika Sharma,1
World's most boring and easiest game! It soo boring. First there are too many ads. Aftet every round you have to watch an ad and a round is less than 10 sec long so you are litrely watching and ad every 10 sec. It is dammm easy to play this game. It is meant for kids for first year of kindergarten. Dont download,1
"Too many advertisements, not enough content. Waste of time",1
"Ridiculous number of ads, 15 second game play for every 30 seconds of ads",1
adds at every level you played boring 🙄,1
an ad every 10 seconds ruins the whole point of it being a game - if I wanted to download a billboard I would have done that,1
Not at all worth the amount of ads you have to watch,1
Baddddd,1
3 second in you get an ad.,1
"Amongus, also friend died, lost fellows",1
"I tried to like it, I really did. Held out for 30+ levels. The game is actually fun, but the sheer volume of advertising is mind numbing. I'd pay for an ad free version, but in it's current state I consider it unplayable due to interuptions every 30 seconds.",1
🙄,1
"Interesting game, but the better you play the more ads you have to watch,like punishment. I understand ads pay, but the ads FAR outweigh playtime. Not a good trade. Give more playtime and I might return.",1
It's good,1
"30 sec ads, then 15 sec gameplay in between ads.. DO NOT INSTALL THIS",1
i hate it deleted my other games >:,1
I like it cus it is so fun to play with your friends and family,1
Too many ads,1
Too much ads,1
رائع,1
Too many ads.,1
More ads than game play! Do not waste your time. This app needs reported for privacy concerns also,1
Lag,1
Its a funny game but after every singke level theres an ad. This really sucks and you loose motivation and fun,1
To many ads after every round.... dont download this game.....,1
Pathetic. You play one round and then have to watch an advert. There is no upside to playing this trash.,1
Ads ads ads just rubbish!!!,1
"Soooo bad, every Fricking 2min there's an with loud music... Uninstall rubbish. They don't let us play",1
There should be an X at the end of an advert so you don't have to shut down the game completely every time. Poor quality.,1
This game have meny glitch and so many ads don't download this game,1
Game is bad,1
Ads and it's bad and the game is not go to let you play the game at on the wifi god I hope the game git shutdow ok.,1
I like this. But their is an ad after every level. So deleting the game.,1
"Ads after every 15 seconds of playing? This is not a game developper, this is an excuse of a game to make money off ads. Ridiculous.",1
Just full of ads. No ty.,1
I played 3 games and I got an ad after each game. I'd be ok if it was one every 3-5 but one after each game is unplayable. You spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game,1
Way too many ads,1
The game sucks and I don't know why someone would make a game like this if you can barely get past the levels. 🙄🙄🙄 If no stars were an option I would definitely choose it and I'm deleting the game. 👎,1
30 seconds of ads for 5 seconds of gameplay,1
More add machene than a game,1
Very glitchy even when internet is not bad,1
game has way too much ads once you go to a next stage you have to watch a ad,1
Tell me one thing honestly. what was the purpose of this application.?? Showing ads or entertain? You guys are showing ad after every level and i can't skip those ads after 5sec. Useless ... Totally waste of time.!!! Uninstalling,1
So many ads,1
"The game is terrible. Here is why: Every time you complete a level you automatically get ads which are annoying The ads take forever to be gone with Overall, this game is dog water do not download it if you want to experience the worst game in your life ever.",1
Way to many adds,1
Hate it hate it ads terrible the the development bteam kys,1
"Too many ads, not a game but a ads app",1
2 many adds give it a break add after every level,1
Game was okay not nice,1
"I've been playing this game for about 10 minutes now and not exaggerating I've seen probably 200 ads. Each level is 10-20 seconds long and there is an ad between each of them. I didn't do a single ""click here to double your reward"" and there were still that many ads. Not worth it!",1
i like 😘😘😊😊,1
Can't see more bad then this,1
"XD, this game blows",1
Boring game with annoying ads.,1
This is absolutely ridiculous there are so many ads I hate it the game is good but the advertising is horrible,1
An ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. including the very first. And worse they deliberately made to not look like ads they're disguised to look just like another level of the game,1
Ads,1
"Was kinda fun, until I realized that the only peceivable story is to kill America. I c ame to this conclusion, because it is the only place you attack.",1
Good,1
Unplayable with so many ads,1
ad after EVERY level. No ty.,1
glitches,1
It is very pro game,1
"Should have expected it from a game that was recommended to me through ads, but you spend more time sitting through ads then you do playing. On top of that you don't actually have any real control over your men, meaning that even if you make the best decision at every gate you could still loose most of your team just because of how the levels are designed. Would not recommend.",1
Ads ads and more ads! Literally an ad after every level. Play for 3 seconds here's an ad. Play another level for 3 seconds here's an ad. Uninstalled after 10 minutes. Spent more time with ads than playing the game.,1
It has so many bugs while over 200 people generates!!!,1
so many adv,1
Fun but not worth the time sucking adverts,1
"Good god, the ADS, the lag that messes with your game.. I havent even had it for an hour and I'm already over it!",1
Too many ads,1
"Nice game to relax playing. But then to ruin it there is an advert after every level, gets ready annoying",1
"Good game, but way too many ads. Everything you do in game ends up in ad. Takes away all the enjoyment.",1
what a waste of potential.....this game is full of ads....you watch more ads than the game itself,1
Tooooooooo many ads... Takes the fun out of the game... Uninstalled,1
THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE ITS SO BORING AND ALL THEY WANT IS MONEY THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS ARE JUST GREEDY SCAMMERS WHO LURE US IN WITH THEIR ADS :/ DEFINITELY NOT A FAN DELETING NOW,1
Too many adverts! Spend most time waiting for adverts to end than actually playing!,1
It is a boring it always hangs and I loss the game whatever this is the worst game...,1
Too much advertising. I can two level in a row,1
Lots of ads,1
Grate game but... to menny ads after each level,1
"Ads, ads, ads. 🤢",1
"Buggy and full of ads. At least once every few levels the crowd I control when it hits an enemy will freeze so I can't complete the level - animations still run, they just dont move, its not my phone freezing. FULL of ads, and theyre very invasive.",1
Way too many ads,1
Ridiculous adverts,1
Was fun to a point but that dies quickly with all the ads. Waaaay to many ads,1
Garbage game. You can't get higher than like 125 people and it has an ad after every level.,1
Monotonous and boring.,1
Ads every 2 seconds!!!,1
Too many ads,1
Way too mamy ads...uninstalled,1
To much ad,1
I can't handle those ads anymore,1
"If you love 30 second ads after every 10 second to complete level, this game is for you.",1
Impossible to play with add overload. You spend more time in adds than you do playing. 5% add time would be ok.,1
"Fun for 5 minutes, ads that crash the game 50% of the time after literally every level. Play in airplane mode.",1
To many ads.,1
Don't ever play the Instagram ad games. Your playing an add not a game lmao.,1
Too many ads,1
Trash. Too many ads.,1
Terrible. Commercials after each level. And each level lasts for 30 seconds.,1
Game is a good time killer however levels are 10 seconds long followed by a 30 second ad. I basically downloaded an app to watch commercials.,1
Got 3 as within the first minutes of playing. Looks like a fun game but too many ads make it unplayable.,1
Ad Land,1
I want a nice reaction timed game but I get are 20 second levels and an advert after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL ITS JUST A SCAM TO GET YOURSELF MONEY and PLAINLY ON ADVERTS ALONE!,1
"The game itself is okay, but the adverts are insanity. The amount of adverts and the way it forces you to watch them between every single click you make is ridiculous. You'll spend more time watching adverts than you will playing this. Total waste of time.",1
"TERRIBLE game! 1. Once i got like, 400 guys, but then theres that thing where u have to walk on it to get to the other side, and its so small so when ur on the other side u only have one guy left. 2. The game takes 10 seconds. The adds take 1 minute. AND IT COSTS LIKE $100 TO REMOVE THE ADS! 3. Time for some math. Fact 1 + fact 2= stupid game. 😂",1
Completely bad game,1
"Great game let down by the adverts. A 10-20second level is immediately followed by an advert. This is on every level. There are far too many adverts to make this playable and no paid option available. It's a simple pick up and play game that focuses on your mental skills, but just too many adverts.",1
It was great at the first the problem is when you have many people it becomes slow.,1
خیلی کسل کنندس,1
Too much ads. It's like playing in between ads rather than the other way round,1
Could have been fun without adds after every attempt... every single attempt...,1
Good game,1
Ads ads ads ads ads.,1
Security concern,1
"It's a fun game,but too much ads,like after every run!!",1
"Oh so many ads, unplayable",1
Bad,1
It would be awesome if I could stop losing units because the ramps aren't big enough,1
"This game is terrible, first of all there are to many adds, also there is no music or noise in the game. The levels are in no order, and I even replay levels.",1
Endless adds. 5 seconds of gameplay then adds. And then more adds .,1
Uninstall the game is trash and there is way too much ads,1
Too many ads.,1
Too many ads!,1
Boring game with too many ads that take too long. Uninstall,1
"The game is great in itself. Ad's after each and every game completion is disasterously annoying. Doesn't even give the option to skip the Ad after watching it for 5-10 seconds. You literally have to click on the link, takes you to App Store and then you again come back to the game to play next level. Not recommended at all !!",1
"Every time you complete a level, which barely takes 30 seconds, you get an ad. What to change your character colour? Well you have to roll on a chance system instead of just choosing one, and if you don't get what you want after the first 2 tries, then you have to watch an ad. This app is a load of advertisements with a bit of gameplay in-between. Avoid at all costs",1
Too many ads,1
"Great game, but not worth the time watching ads. Each level takes maybe 15 seconds or less. The ads are like 30+ seconds. Sure. Good luck with that. I know, you can play offline but still....",1
Hi Hello,1
"The game play is fun a touch glitchy, the ads are the main part of the game though I didn't download a game to be spammed by ad's",1
After every single level there is an ad and they are about 10-30seconds long.The developers are trying to fill their pockets with cash.The game play is not challenge what so ever.Very disappointing.,1
Fun game to many ads 🤦‍♂️.,1
Adds every minute,1
Muchos comerciales uno cada nivel y el comercial es más largo que el juego muy aburrido asi,1
Bad,1
You will spend more time stuck watching ads rather than playing the game.,1
How many Ads do you need? Jesus christ don't bother,1
Ads on bottom of screen 24/7... Trash development.,1
More ads than actual gameplay 🤮,1
Tons of adds and bad grammar.,1
"It's an ad machine, every short level followed by lengthy ads",1
"Way to many ads do not waste your time, played 3 rounds and gave up",1
Ratio between time playing VS watching advertisements is terrible,1
Terrible game for kids!!! Every 30 seconds there is an add. Add will show up in middle of the game.,1
Fol dis apps very bad ds game,1
Add after add after add. If I wanted to play I'd have to wade through the garbage that they showed me just to plow through more after I was done. Quickly binned.,1
A fun ADD with not many games in it.,1
"Just started playing and immediately uninstalling. Ads after every single level. I get that the company needs to make money, but you already have banner ads. Ads after every single round, really? And a game with little variation and complexity through levels after sitting through the ads is okay at best.",1
Terrible,1
Too many ads,1
Way to many ads to be a good game and you can't even reach the end,1
Yes it's very bad app it is not installed,1
Advert after each level.... delete,1
If you like watching adds this is the game 20sec level followed by a great reward 30sec of adds.,1
Just an ad revenue game. Almost no challenge or enjoyment.,1
What is this games I give 0 rating ok.,1
Ad after every level. Bad.,1
"If you like ads, this game is for you.",1
"This game is actual garbage, I knew it was going to be garbage before I even downloaded it but I did anyways because I have no life. I then swiftly turned off my internet so I didn't get bombarded by ads only to find that you're not actually allowed to make progress without ads. 10/10 kys",1
"When each level is about 10 seconds long and you place a 30 second ad after every single level, your uncreative and repetitive game gets 1 star. Don't waste your time with this game.",1
"Too many ads and app lags due to same, seems like playing game in ads",1
pinakabobong laro na nalaro ko,1
Constant adverts one or two yeah OK after ever level. These people need rounding up and shooting in the back of the head,1
Way to many ads after every level,1
Watching ads to get stuff doesn't work. I watched an ad 3 times to get a skin. And after I just decided to not get it and then guess what? They had me watch another ad. Absolutely terrible 😞,1
Too many ads,1
"Full of ads, unplayable, if you try to play with this app you'll end in viewing a lot of ads.",1
"Way, way, way too many ads gave up after 10 minutes the amount of ads just kills this game",1
There is an ad after each level. It takes longer to watch each ad than to play each level. A waste of time. Uninstalled.,1
So many ads. Seriously so many ads,1
1 minute ad for 10 seconds of gameplay... no thanks.,1
Fun game but when I got I played it for about 2 weeks then it sat on my phone for about 3 months there are too many ads 2 or 3 in-between 1 level and if you want a prize you have to watch an ad fun but gets boring really fast only get if you like watching ads of if you have a lot of free time👎,1
so many ads !,1
"5 mins of advertising for 2 seconds of play, why ?",1
"adds after every single round, adds to show you more adds because this is adds. played about 10min and deleted way to many adds, if you like adds you'll love this adds are the name of the game here. did I mention the adds?",1
To many adds,1
"Too many ads. Like other reviews, too many ads. Greedy devs making an average game. Dont give them the satisfaction of easy money",1
WAY TO MANY ADS!! I uninstalled after my 4th ad between levels.,1
"Add's farm, better look for something else.",1
Super duper hit game wow I love it,1
The number of ads is ridiculous. How is this a top rated free game? Have to start questioning what's going on with Google.,1
game yang menarik untuk di dowload,1
"Way to many adds, at least one per level wouldn't recommend this to anyone",1
A lot of ads!,1
It's very laggy. Lots of ads as well.,1
It's trash 😈😈😈😈,1
WAY too many ads. I had to delete the app because it was incredibly frustrating to have to watch a full length ad between each level.,1
add after every lvl,1
TO MANY FREAKING ADS,1
"Too many ads, unplayable",1
You play a game for 20 seconds and watch two minutes of ads.,1
"Péssimo, não tem nada oque fazer além de ganhar algumas skins e dominar alguns territórios. A parte de territórios é extremamente entediante, e não a nada de novo para fazer no jogo, enjoa depois de pouco tempo. Os diamantes, que eram para ser importantes, não tem a mínima utilidade. Perdi tempo e neurônio com isso, recomendo não baixarem.",1
Too many ads. Uninstalled,1
It is soooo laggy and i know tht it is not my phone problem it is the game,1
"Utterly obnoxious with the adverts. One plays after every single level, so expect to watch 3 or 4+ adverts in the space of a minute.",1
More ADs than gameplay,1
"Oh my god the ads are ridiculous! The first level takes 10 actual seconds to play, and you have to watch a 60 second ad to get to the 2nd level. I can't imagine having the patience to make it to the third level.",1
Waaaay to many adverts that just drag on & on !!!,1
Too many adds,1
Too many adds,1
Boring as hell....only gave 1 star because there's not a zero star option.,1
"Was fun, the Ads completely ruined this. Such potential drenched in horrible forcible Ads.",1
Waayyyyy to many ads... greedy,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
I2,1
Bad sub,1
"Seems like a cool game- except the developers are greedy punks, seriously an ad after EVERY play?! Yea no thank you deleting game... Wish there was a way to give NEGATIVE stars",1
"too much ads, repetitive game.",1
Spend more time watching adverts than playing the game... might aswell make the game an advert.,1
"Forced Ads after every level, Ads are longer than the levels. Uninstalled after 5 mins.",1
Installed. Played a couple rounds. Uninstalled. Way too many adds to be even close to enjoyable.,1
"Holy ads, batman! This is ridiculous.. earn x amount of coins/beat however many levels and unlock this skin by also watching an ad. Don't want the skin/to watch the ad? Ok! No skin, but you still have to watch a different ad.",1
"Excessive ads = uninstalled. I can't imagine many people wanting to play a 10 second level followed by a 30 second ad. It'd be interesting to see the % churn on this, bet it's in the high 90's of uninstalling within 5mins.",1
Love game,1
Badads,1
This game is belong to pure Advertise. I play many free app game but this is totally belongs to advertise. Owner never think that player only think money money money. Good thpughts. Best of luck team.,1
Not fun at all,1
DO YOU LOVE ADS?! YOULL LOVE THIS FREE WATCH ADS GAME ALL YOU DO IS WATCH ADS THATS IT! EASY TO LEVEL UP JUST WATCH MORE ADS! So many games ruined by so many ads,1
It is very very very very very very very ver veryy very very very very very very very much ads 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠🤬,1
Waaaayy too many ads. Not worth the time honestly. If mobile game companies want to keep players engaged and make money. Why not space out the ads and not have a video segment and then a playable segment. Why not just do a playable segment? Either way the game itself is not good enough or entertaining enough to keep anyone playing.,1
crashes,1
Really? An add after every level. You spend more time watching adds then you do playing the game.,1
10 million downloads? Guys this game may be basic as all get out but think of their revenue.......jesus.,1
"Absolutely horrible Laggy,boring,loads of adds",1
Ads are showing up every time you pass 1 level.,1
Too many adverts. Do I have to turn off my mobile data and wifi each time I play this game?,1
Hooooorible long ads! I couldn't even get through the first few minutes. Game actually looked fun but the ads are really really bad.,1
Waaaaaay to many ads,1
It's the game from all the adds in between all the ads. It's terrible 👎,1
Bad game Dont get this is horrible,1
Yo I love this game I simp for creator 😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😍😍,1
Too many ads,1
"Way too many ads, ad after every 10sec level.",1
"30 seconds of gameplay followed by several minutes of ads, this is exactly what's wrong with mobile games nowadays",1
"Ungodly amount of adverts, even in between levels. Bonus level where you go and ""attack"" and have to pick the ""best route"", you still lose even if you pick the best route (mathematically, which they highlight for you anyway). Just stupid really",1
"Way too many ads. Very basic game too, but seems like a money making scam as per usual.",1
"Unplayable, more ads than gameplay",1
Ads after every level... Every 30 seconds... No thank you!,1
Very bad 😞😞😞😞😞 game.,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Very bad game. Sala gives 30 sec add every 5 sec after 5 sec game. Never seen this bad game till date,1
I hate it sometimes,1
So many ads make it horrible ewwwww,1
To many ads. I get it you need money to shell out this game in a different skin every week but come on,1
Imran,1
Yet another one of these completely pointless games,1
There is adverts every second after every single level. I would not recommend:(,1
"Ads, ads and some more ads. Oh there also loads of ads, followed by more ads, and a few more ads",1
Poor and too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
15 second round followed by 2 min ad. Not that fun anyway,1
Plz i dont want to see adds again if u want more stars,1
"Too much adds, its a app for adds more than game",1
Way to many adds,1
"Another cheaply made game with a decent premise. This would be a good game for car rides or waiting rooms, but the amount of ads turns this game in to a painful experience that at times feels like it shouldn't be legal. It's shameful and was a waste of my time.",1
"The game is unrealistic, first the skins have faces (the pictures) but when you equip them there's no face. Scammers, and that your suppose to get a lot of people right, well when I got to 423 it lagged and they all fell. Your game is bad payed no wonder why your showing ads after levils. Crowd fight is better than this rip off. 5 star ratings are bots and telling you that, you can turn aeroplane mode, I don't care about the ads. Even I can make a cool game. But I'm to young.",1
Adds adds adds and adds,1
"Match ad, match ad, match match, ad ad ad. Cool idea, too many ads. Makes good game bad game. It's too bombarded my ads, it's not fun.",1
So many ads this is absurd,1
Great if youre brain dead!,1
"Nice game, but the amount of ads is absurd",1
There's an advert every 30 seconds. A little too aggressive for my liking. Uninstalled.,1
Not the best quality or technology. The ads keep freezing the game and I have to keep restarting it.,1
Terrible,1
"Made my phone freeze and restart after only 2 times playing it. Don't install, it's a bug or viral.",1
Rubbish so boring so many ads I'm deleting it,1
"the most heavily advertised I've ever been, before every level, and I do mean every single level,it plays an add, the levels are fun, but only last maybe a minutr and then there are more adds",1
Freefire ys count masters,1
The amount of ads in this game is crazy,1
Greed/laziness kills the game. 30 seconds of ads for 10 seconds of play. Disappointing. Great idea lousy execution.,1
Too much ads don't install,1
"Very poor 40s of ads after 15s of play, uninstalled@",1
The boss is a cop that you have to kill...anti cop BS game should be banned.,1
Too many ads,1
WAY too many ads that you can't skip out on.,1
Far too many ads. Disrespectful. Uninstalling.,1
Very good,1
More ads than gameplay.,1
"Among us imposter, insert music here.",1
Tak best,1
"What a HORRIBLE game!! The levels are roughly 15-20 seconds each and after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL you have to watch an ad, most of which last longer than the actual level itself. Played 3 levels and am now going to delete the app, don't download or support this trash app!",1
Constant ads every couple levels just ridiculous,1
"It's awful, games with these many ads are getting ridiculous",1
An add after every round,1
"There isn't enough space to fit all of your people, so they have no choice but to die",1
0 stars if it were possible. Ads regardless of not taking bonus's.,1
Fake game 30seconds game play 30 minutes Ads ads ads ads uninstall I think,1
App of ads,1
मेरे मोबाइल मे ये गेम डाउनलोड नहि होरहीहे मे क्या करु,1
i like this game but ads is for paying apps. not like this🙄🙄🙄.,1
Tiene muchos aununcios y no deja que uno se entretenga jugando,1
Just another clone. Would be much better if the game would continue rather than beating levels. It's always the same thing and that's boring.,1
Way too many ads.,1
It's a boring,1
So very many ads,1
What a crock ads in game 5 minute and end of every level. Uninstall developer you are bad.,1
many ads irritating,1
To easy and to many adds,1
"As everyone else says, this is more ad than game. Bored within about 10 minutes gameplay, which took nearly an hour due to ads. Don't bother.",1
All 5 stars are bots,1
Invasive Ads,1
"Terrible game.....game is programmed so that you never cross the finish line with more than 150 guys,theres no space more 200 guys on the platform and game lags with and without and internet connection which mades dodging obstacles difficult but the end result is always the same,you always win theres no challenge,just frustration trying to get the score multiplier at the end..dont wast your time and data",1
"Disappointed with this app as my viewing of adverts is occasionally interrupted with a game you can play. I downloaded this solely for the hundreds of ads it has, don't spoil it by putting the actual game up every so often...",1
After every level there's an ad its ridiculous,1
As everyone has mentioned same problem.,1
"Game needs more ads, 1 ad every minute is rookie numbers...",1
so slow and it kept glitching.,1
The game is full of adverts and can't be control' that's poor,1
Too many ads,1
Aggressive ads,1
This game is a rubbish 👻👻😼😭😸😹💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩,1
Wow nice game ever,1
bad,1
"Play 5 seconds, WATCH ADS FOR 30.... DESIGNED BY IDIOTS, TARGETING IDIOTS. LITERALLY THE MOST SHAMELESS, AD WATCHING MONEY GRAB POS I HAVE EVER SEEN. STAY AWAY. BETTER YET, HACK THIS POS COMPANY'S SERVERS AND WIPE THEM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH. All for legit devs making legit ad revenue. But this group is a festering sore combined with a malignant, cancerous tumor.",1
So many unnecessary ads,1
So bad,1
If I could give it a zero I would,1
Too many ads.,1
it sucks that all i gonna say.,1
"This game made me install adblock on my device. As most other reviews say, there's a tiny bit of gameplay in between each ad. Not to mention the game being a laggy pos until the removal of ads. After removing the ads, the game was enjoyable, though it has a very short lifespan as the blue gems become useless within like 2 hours as you finish the building part. After that it's just run 2 short levels, do a boss level for literally nothing and repeat. Don't play this game...",1
Literally an ad after every level. Also no difficulty for anyone that went to school.,1
To many adds,1
"When I'm actually playing it it's kind of fun. Simple game. However. The rounds are too short and the ads after every single round are longer than the game. I have to Uninstall, can't stand the ads.",1
🔞,1
I heat this game its so so so bad 👎,1
Duuuuuude. You ruined a perfectly good game with this ad nonsense. I'd pay five bucks to play it without the ads. Where is that option?,1
Absolutely unplayable. Ad after ad after ad.,1
This game has sooooooooo much fuc#1ng ads!,1
Was really enjoying the game till one of the ads froze my phone fired about 10 minutes and I thought I was going to have to reset it. Had to delete app,1
THIS GAME IS AWFLE! I played for a while and got a high score but for some reason I always got THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS!! And the ads are ridiculous! FIX THIS GAME ABD MAYBE I WILL LIKE IT!!! 😝😝😡😡😡,1
"I remember a time before ads and how great it was to just download a game a freaking play it... This is kinda sad honestly.. A bunch of kids are downloading this on their parents phones or tablets, nobody actually plays this pathetic excuse for a ""game"".",1
"The premise is enjoyable, but the game is way too easy and 4 levels in, I had already spent more time watching ads than playing the game.",1
"Ridiculous number of ads, Aug 20 to 30 second until the next ad. Once ad is finished you click on the x to close and you get another ad.",1
"I enjoyed the game but a add after every level is a bit much, shame as it was fun but tedious with adds. Avoid.",1
An unskippable ad plays after each level,1
Worst game because its boring,1
Broke - got stuck on level 17,1
This game is so unplayable with the amount of ads they have.,1
"Ads, ads, ads. 2 seconds of game time for every 30 seconds of ads.",1
Please not install this there is a lot of ads in the game,1
Advert AIDS,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads. It's annoying. The game until worth it.,1
"You spend about twice as much time watching ads as you do playing. Plus, it's ludicrously simple.",1
"Absolute rubbish, ads after every single level",1
Boring,1
Trash.,1
cool game ruined by ads. when u spend more time being forced to watch ads than actually playing the game you get deleted immediately.,1
"Lags terribly and has ads after every single round which are only seconds long, unplayable",1
The game is bad. I wouldn't recommend it. Threre are ads every level and the levels are short and i have an exelent device and the amount of lag is unreal. And the game isnt that good either. One star,1
More ads than game .. Don't waste your time,1
Too much ad don't download,1
This is faltu game,1
"Terrible. First stage took a few seconds, followed by a long ad. Waste of time.",1
so many ads...i want to buy the game.,1
"Completed the first level then ad, second level then BOOM another ad, third level which this ad to get a bonus... Don't wanna get the bonus well your watching an ad anyways... Levels are way to small and if the game decides your dead your gonna die... Then BOOM another ad, deleted this as is one giant ad disguised as a game",1
Do you like,1
To many unskipable ad's,1
This game are so lagging for my handphone vivo y20 2021 ram4 gb please fix this game because it very weird to play it,1
Just ads. So many ads. The game is impossible to enjoy.,1
Forced ad after every single 10 second stage is too much. Would like to love the game but can't.,1
More ads than play.,1
Minimal effort. Somehow it is worse than advertised in an incredibly boring ad.,1
X and Zzzzzzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzź--zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzźzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Z,1
Too many advertising,1
🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉,1
Contains so many ads,1
Tieudydhhz,1
Adds every single level,1
Pure pubblicity for crypto currency. Nothing else.,1
So much of adds,1
"I'm not sure how this is a game there isn't really anything here to play and time wise there are more ads than ""game"".",1
Lots of ads then froze. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.,1
this has more adds then the paid programing show on tv,1
30 second ads after every 10 second level,1
To much ads... don't install this..,1
Ads,1
Worst game. There are alot a lot number of adds that is literally irritating. There's no meed of having so much ads so frequently and not getting the skins because there isnt add to have the skin but there are a lot of ads for other things. Sick game . Dont download it. Its just a waste of time.,1
Unskippable ads. Can't move between levels without installing whatever it is showing you. Avoid like the plague.,1
"Too many ads, I can't cope. Uninstalling",1
"Fun game, way too many ads. You have to watch an ad to ""win"" the skin you ""earn"". Too bad. Plus ads between each VERY short level. Just not worth it.",1
If you like playing ad games then this is for you every button u hit seems to be another ad not worth the time every lvl is a new ad so good luck,1
plz give me 8000 us,1
It's an advert with 5 secs of play,1
Ad after another,1
To many Ads,1
More adverts than game play. Absolute joke,1
most fun with this game is when i deleted it,1
"Deleted it after a few levels. Fun game and I would like to keep playing it, but you spend more time on ads than the actual game. Seriously, an ad after every level. The levels take 10 seconds and the ads are 30 seconds.",1
Enjoyed the game at first but after 200 levels (and what feels like 1000 ads) the game felt very shallow with very little challenge.,1
Nice game,1
داوپش پدرتو قوردم این چه بازی بولیشتیه دیه😐,1
"This game is horrible, no matter what you do it always makes you loose some",1
It has some gameplay between ads. the company should close and they should go do a different jobs. the amount of ads it should be Illegal. Maybe google should ban these games.,1
"Ads every 30 seconds. I dont like anything from this developer. These ""io"" games are bs",1
Offline is a lie. They changed it to online and endless ads. Don't be fooled. Wish I could report it,1
Tons of ads,1
Can't remove ads...at all...so annoying,1
You watch ads more than you play.,1
"Good game, but stupid amount of ads",1
"They don't even have faith in their own game, they don't expect you to play past level 20, after level 20 it's just constant level repeats, even bosses.",1
Glitches every game,1
Ads,1
"Kept seeing ads of this game where most people could not possibly be that bad. Still true after trying the game, but the levels require less time and inputs than the ads between each level. Game would slow down and stutter with certain animations but levels weren't difficult enough for it to matter. Then the game froze with a boss animation. The game is as bad as the ads would leave you to believe.",1
ads game,1
Tooo bad Tooo many ads Spend more time watching ads than playing,1
Too many ad,1
Dogshit,1
"Kebanyakan iklan, orang cuma mau main game sambil dengerin lagu tapi iklan ganggu, lagu jadi mati mulu. Iklannya juga gak jelas, gak suka",1
Stupid game. Kids: don't waste ur lives,1
"I barely did anything in 10 seconds before I watched an ad I couldn't mute or press (x). Honestly I'm horrified with this. It's shocking it's even legal. If I could 0/5, I would.",1
This is laging,1
"Boring and black screen. Played several levels, all the same give or take and super short. Earn enough exp to unlock skins but then have to watch an advert to collect them which is bs. Finally after about 14 levels the game went to a black screen and even after force stopping it didn't work again. Glad to be honest.",1
An ad every 30 seconds makes it unplayable. Dont say you weren't warned.,1
The ads kill this game,1
More ads to God of ads!,1
Toooooooooo much of Ads...,1
I get that this is a quick cash grab but getting 3 min of ads for every 1 mins of play is retarded,1
Levels are short and ads are.longer than the levels,1
"Had to UNINSTALL, mainly because of the DISCUSSTING amount of ads we're stuck watching after every round of game play but also because when I defeated the king/boss and get offered a new ""skin"" it ask if I want the skin I just have to watch a ad, I hit the ""no thanks"" button and what's the game do, IT MAKES ME WATCH A AD ANYWAYS, with the amount of ads I decided...BYE BYE, ADIOS, SEE YA LATER, UNINSTALLED",1
"Awful game. More ad than game. Played for 5 minutes, 2.5 of which were bite-sized ads. Done the few runs needed to get that skin ? Watch an ad to unlock or lose it. Want to build a base to progress? Watch an ad. This is adware that's parading as a game. Avoid at all costs. Also, on the later (and by that I mean fourth) levels the game gets laggy. If you play well, the game lags !",1
"This game is fun, But I gave 1 star because of the nonstop ads, cant even breath, try to improve it by disable the ads.",1
Ads simulator....,1
Forced ads after the very first into level.. Instantly uninstalled..,1
Aweful. 5 second level followed by 20-30 second ads. This should not even be allowed on the store.,1
Great game. Too many ads. Uninstalling. Game itself is good but watch more ads than playtime.,1
I don't like this game it's so boring and this game is for baby I don't rate this game,1
RIDICULOUS amount of ads. Game would be fun if you didn't get two ads after each level.,1
Far too many ads,1
"Garbage. Thousands of ads from the moment you start, almost every action you do is an ad wall.",1
Too many Ads,1
Too many ads!!!!!,1
Ads and more ads,1
Donlod lat,1
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. There is an ad every ten seconds and after and before each level. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME,1
Very bad... ad time is more then playing time..😝😝😝😝... i do not recommend this game to eneny... its stress causing game..,1
Way to many adds,1
Way too many adverts. Every button you press has a 30 second advert. These mount up to incredibly long times!,1
This sucks there is literally an add after every single level,1
"too many ads, each level got ads.",1
WAY too many ads!!!!,1
Its not as enjoyable its really annoying when you finish and it turns off so i uninstalled the app btw im his daughter so ye,1
Ads unavoidable,1
"Play 15s of game get 1min of ad, that's pure aids.",1
Too much ads After every level there is ha ad,1
It does not let me install the game,1
So many unskipable ads,1
"If you're looking for an easy game to cap out on in less than 5 hours of play time, this is for you. Once the battle for the continent is done and you have unlocked all of the skins the game has nothing to give you except 1.5 to 2 minutes of ads between 30 to 45 seconds of play. Unless of course you want to waste the $2.99 to go ad free, this may knock off about 2 hours from the time needed to clear the battles.",1
"Avoid this app developer. They crank out ad generators rather than games. Offers an ad watch every 20 seconds. Even if you press no? Shows you one anyway. Funniest part? The most efficient way to play is to close and reopon the game over and over. You literally save about 10 seconds a pop. But I digress, just don't support this developer by installing their bs.",1
"Kind if pointless unless you really enjoy watching ads. The only reason I downloaded it was because I was spammed with this game's ad, and so I was like: fine, I'll see. But please, if you are here because you saw too many of its ads, do not download it. This is a waste of your time. 😑😓",1
5 sec levels followed by 20 sec adds... Just terrible,1
Too many ads.,1
"Mindless, simple levels and the ads.... my goodness are there some ads in this game. To yourself a favour and totally avoid this game...trust me you have better things to do.",1
It stops constantly,1
"Advertising is brutal. Makes it unplayable. I get trapped in loops forcing me to Google play. Totally unplayable. It's 25% play time, 75% trying to get out the Advertising traps. Advertising is forced after each level.",1
"Terrible, you will watch the same frigging ad over and over again everytime you complete a level haha what a joke",1
An ad after every single level. This means you're playing time about equals the time you watch ads.,1
"This game would be so much fun if I could just pay for an ad free version, as is, it's unplayable for the amount of ads.",1
Oo bhai tmhari game men itny add hn phly inhe khtm kro baad men ana jahil log Pagal log pta ni kahan se uth krr a jaty hn,1
"Boring. Plus, the ads are longer than the levels AND THERE'S ONE BETWEEN EACH LEVEL.",1
All you do is just run I like it a litte bit. Put some up grades and I'll like it,1
Ads ads ads ads.,1
I wanna give it a zero but that's not possible so I give it a one I trusted this and it disappointed me I wish I never stopped by,1
Sooooo many adds more time watching ads than playing,1
"Frankly, this game s*cks. It's frustrating, because you will never reach high scores as the game will simply not let you keep high numbers of minions and to make any progress at all or unlock skins you always need to watch ads. Unfortunately not possible to give 0 stars",1
Just ads,1
To much adds,1
Do you like ads every five seconds?,1
Too many ads.,1
To many ads,1
Only ADS,1
Worst,1
WAY TOO MANY ADS LMAO,1
Trash,1
Cant even play and laggs to much,1
"Way too many ads,not worth the time",1
"I see your problem, there is a math equation in the middle of your add channel, want to get that looked at. Got sick of it halfway through my morning dump",1
I read the reviews and I was going to get the but now I'm not it's sounds so boring,1
Ads,1
"Waaaaay too many ads, like literally after every single level. Uninstalled it after a couple of levels. Ok, I understand the point of ads in a free game, but still, too much is too much sometimes.",1
Good God too many adds don't waste your time,1
Having ads after each stage is not a good experience.,1
0/10,1
To many ads,1
More ads then any game I have ever played,1
Way too many ads.,1
"The game is a lot of fun, but it so choked with ads, you spend more time watching commercials than playing. Uninstalled after 10 very frustrating minutes, which is a shame, because the actual game is great.",1
Hous,1
"Fun game, 90% video adds. No thanks.",1
Nothing except of ads...,1
"The developers had a choice between making a game, or an advert. They chose an advert",1
Too many ads,1
"Even though it's free, games that have an advert after every.......... single........... level get deleted immediately, especially when the advert lasts longer than the level you've just played.",1
Very bad game and useless game,1
Adpocalypse,1
Way too many ads. Deleted the game,1
So much adds its painful,1
An excuse to shove ads down your throat,1
Way too many ads. Also if I opt out of watching an ad.. I shouldn't have to sit through another ad. 😂,1
Way too many ads. When you finish a level you immediately get a either very long skippable ad or long unskippable ad,1
Its too much really too much ads. Please stop inventing such apps for the sake of it,1
Game is boring after 5 minutes 10 seconds of play for 60 seconds of adds. Try to X the adds out and it opens the play store and Galaxy store. All together the worst spam game I have ever played.,1
Ad after every lvl. No thanks.,1
Ads are longer than the levels!,1
Advert game.,1
Horrible game with an insane amount of ads. More ads than playtime.,1
Way too many ads. There is an ad after every level.,1
Tons of ad,1
"Retaded game, add after each level",1
This was the last of the three year old and Daddy and the words that he was a very young person who would have been in a different way than he is now in garden time but I,1
"DO NOT INSTALL, spent more time watching ads than getting to play the game TOTALLY NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!",1
Don't bother with this- the ad's are constant and excruciating,1
Ad every level,1
"There is a reason this game is below 4. Rest all are gake reviews. Worst game, intrusive adds, they are spending money on devilish add campaign. Not on game experience.",1
PARAMJEET,1
Ads.....Ads....Ads.....Ads,1
"bruh the ads for it are stupid, and then it's to laggy and I have a Iphone 12, horrible just pls take this game down it's so bad LMAO.",1
Way too many very long ads.,1
Ads! So many Ads Uninstalled.,1
Boring,1
I wish it didn't have levels and just kept going and going and going. Kind of like Temple Run.,1
Bad that's all u need to know,1
Repetitive and not challenging,1
There are so many adds that's why I dislike it and gave just one star..if this add Vali bachodi is removed this game is a freaking 5 star... But ya so many motherfuc***adds...dude uninstall this game if the add problem isn't resolved,1
Ads and not too fun.,1
Tooo many ads am deleting,1
To many ads,1
"SO MANY ADS! I understand this is a free game so there is going to be ads. But my goodness, you get ads after every single game! The game lasts about 8 seconds, then you get 30 seconds of ads every single time! I'm uninstalling this game because of to many ads. I could live with an ad every 3 to 5 games, but an ad every game is to much!",1
30 second ads every round... Nah im good,1
it was bad,1
Game play is OK shame about the adverts after every level DO NOT DOWNLOAD,1
You have to watch an add every 10 sec. Sucks,1
This is trash. You decline an ad to get an ad. I said no to a skin because it wanted me to watch an ad and I got an ad anyway. 100% do not recommend,1
the game itself is fun but after every 15 second round there's a 10 second ad. the levels are also so repetitive. not worth it at all. don't waste your time.,1
Unplayable due to ridiculous amount of ads. Spend far more time on ads then playing the game.,1
"App has a major problem with lag spikes. I can generally accept frequent ads if the game is playable, but the way it just freezes out of nowhere has me losing more rounds than I win.",1
"Boring, too many adds and it was very laggie.",1
Waaaay too many ads!!!!!! Makes it boring and unplayable for any longer than a couple of minutes! Advert greedy revenue grabber! Uninstalled after 10 minutes!,1
Not good worse than 1 star,1
Trash ads scam,1
"Irritating in the extreme, as after every level, no complexity, waste of memory and time. Uninstalled.",1
Ad breeding ground.,1
Not thank,1
"The number of ads makes the game unplayable. Every level takes about 15 seconds to complete, followed by a minimum 30 second ad. And no option to purchase ad-free. This game is a LOSER.",1
Game was deleted after the first game CONSTANT ADS AVOID,1
"10 seconds game 1min adds. Adds every 10 seconds. I know, I know free games have to have adds. But common, so much!? Uninstalled!",1
छणझ,1
"Hopeless, bad non challenging game that has too many ads",1
The game has more adds than actual gameplay ... Not to mention it forces you to watch them to make progress.,1
It is just an advertisement displaying application and not a game. Minus rating for showing multiple ads.,1
Too many ads. Completely ruins the game.,1
Game made to feed you ADS every 20 sec.,1
Nothing but ads! Joke.,1
Too many ads.,1
After everytime you finish a level you have to watch a ad there's more adds then there is game,1
Such boring game it like be rounding rounding on same road,1
"Ads after ever level (some with forced sound) and the group gets so big, you literally have no choice but to kill some.",1
"WARNING DO NOT DOWLNLOAD!!! It puts a virus on ur device which means:the moisture alert comes up,no texting and stealing ur info",1
"Ten seconds of gameplay, followed by half a minute of ads. Uninstalling this garbage.",1
"This is a advert app with occasional game play in between. There is an advert at the end of every level which takes longer to watch the the level takes to play. Every button click opens an advert and there are banner ads that cover part of the game. Seriously, why does Google promote this sort of cash cow?",1
Could be a really addictive game but the ads destroy it. Every 10 seconds you're bombarded with an advert so I'm deleting it. Tried playing with the WiFi switched off but the game just buffers waiting for an advert to play.,1
Not interested,1
Ads literally ever 20 to 30sec of play.,1
"Feels like they made about 20% of a game & then stopped. Lots of ads (the other reviews are not exaggerating), but after you get all the skins (9 total) & the very limited territory available in ""Build"" mode, that's it--there's literally nothing left in the game other than repetitive levels, which are basically indistinguishable from one to the next. Each lasts about 10-15 sec each before another 20-30 sec ad pops up. There's nothing to even spend the in-game currency on. Would not recommend.",1
Too many ads,1
Adverts with a game thrown in. The amount of adverts is greater than the actual game play.,1
Nothing but forced advertisement,1
Game was ok just was ruined by the adds literally after each level ubget bombarbed by the adds and no choice to disable them,1
its just ads. not challenging at all,1
Interesting idea. I don't enjoy game when the adds are not optional.,1
10 seconds of game play 20 seconds of adverts,1
This is horrible in the first 5 minutes of the game I already had over 8 ads,1
"Fun, silly game. Wouldn't mind playing it if there wasn't an ad after EVERY single level. Garbage.",1
"Tooooo many ads, impossible to play the game after each lvl -> add, adds on the bottom ads everywheeeree",1
Full of ads 3 x the acceptable amount and really laggy,1
"I like the game, but the frequency and duration duration of ads versus gameplay needs a better balance.. the app is currently an ad streamer which is also a game and not the other way around.uninstalled it after getting annoyed by ads",1
Ad after every level. Uninstalled.,1
"Literally was on the app 10 seconds and got hit with an ad. 15 seconds later, another ad. Pathetic",1
If I could give this game sorry more like add showcase 0 stars I would because it is a waist if time and the add for it pissis me off so much on other games. Just play something like pokemon GO or you will lose your mind over this waste of pixles.,1
Just nothing to it. To many ads.,1
Too many ads,1
Ads overload,1
Advertising on every play do not download,1
Very worst game i have seen ever.,1
Good game but there is an add after every 10 second level.,1
Too many long ads,1
Horrible. Tones of ads. You cannot enjoy playing it!,1
This is not a game it just a bunch of ads. Worst game ever. Please Don't download it.,1
The game has not good. Its a source of income for owner . Ads and ads every time. I'm going to uninstall it,1
Too many ads,1
Too many Ads😑,1
Very lose game,1
Too much ads and the ads are long. Not worth to play.,1
This game sucks,1
"Literally every time the ads after the game last longer than the game itself. The games are quite random and you have no options of being clever about anything. Each round only lasts about 15-30 seconds and then you need to watch 3 ads to get to the next lever.... Absolute waste of time, so boring",1
I have downloaded this game and then I saw a extra app with no name(it shows app info when i press it for a while) had come to my phone. I uninstalled the game but that app info is not gine yet. For second try I have downloaded that game for second time and then one extra app info again had come to my phone and when that game was still in my phone I couldn’t even open that app info. I deleted that game but that 2 app info is still in my phone. Is this a hacking app or something like that?,1
BORING!!! SOMEBODY SHOOT ME PLEASE!! If your looking to be bored to death then this is the game for you. I played for about 5 minutes before deleting it and wondering what papers I needed to file to get those 5 minutes of my life back!!!! You seriously have to be on the low end of the spectrum to think this game is exciting! I'm mad that I can't give it anything less than 1 star cause even thats giving it too much credit.,1
"Too easy, endlessly spammed with ads.",1
ad revenue game. Play one level and then watch ads to continue playing that are longer than the level itself,1
"After every level you have to watch a ad.if you don't like it,you still have to watch it",1
"Thousands of ads, time spend on ads more than the game.",1
This game could be fun. The ads after ads after adds just kill it.,1
Too many ads. Deleted within 2 mins.,1
"Advertising spam, absolutely rubbish!",1
The ads killed the game. Game fine but a ad after 1 game its not worth your time.,1
"Just sayin', terrible game",1
I didn't find this relaxing or fun.,1
Complete garbage fire of a game,1
"This app was just made to give you ads. Within the first minute of playing, I had to watch 4 ads just to continue to the next levels. It is a disgrace that this game is at the top of any chart.",1
Ads every 15 seconds.,1
A pathetic amount of unskippable ads. Lame.,1
Would you like some game with your ads??,1
Constant Ads every level = uninstall.,1
This nice game but in ad is is different on 2gb moblie,1
Waaaay too many ads.,1
Its a game of ads people want to make profit... Its not fun too easy its not a game.,1
There are WAYYYYYYYYY too many ads. Most games you get to play 3 or 4 runs at least before you get an ad. This is literally after EVERY SINGLE RUN and more. Iliterally played for 10 minutes before I got annoyed and deleted the game.,1
"Extremely easy, Way to many ads.",1
Getting ads 24/7,1
remove those ad,1
"3 levels, 3 ads.",1
"I liked the game, but too many ads that waste my time.. Uninstalling it",1
Game would be entertaining if you weren't bombarded by an add every 30 seconds...,1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT PUTS A VIRUS ON YOUR PHONE. I think it was called count masters or something, very upsetting",1
Uninstull,1
This app is great if you only want to watch ads and give this guy big cash instead of play video game. :),1
An add after every level which is over after 20 seconds ridiculous!,1
There is game in your ads.... Fix it....,1
Clicked download. Read the reviews about the ads.. uninstalled.,1
No point to install 😕,1
Ads ads ads.. I get that your game needs to be profitable but when it detracts from the game this much it really ruins the whole fun aspect.,1
Countless adds instead of being able to play. Can't stand it,1
Ads,1
"i wouldn't be surprised if they spent more money on ads instead of the actual game, disappointing",1
So many ads,1
I know ads are needed to make money but I don't care for games where there's an ad after every single level.,1
"Basically a kids math game, even if you take the best options most levels will have some sort of obstacle that forces you to loose a chuck of you characters such as a narrow jump or spinning blade you physically can't get around making the game feel pointless and easy. Also riddled with ads, I can understand ads to unlock stuff for free but just to play every level is a bit much.",1
Add is very psin full,1
More ads than game,1
"An ad after level. Maybe if there was more to it and it was more fun, it'd be worth watching ads for. But it's not.",1
Install problems,1
"Pathetic. Too much add, seems like they have made it for the advertisements rather then let us play the game.😡",1
There's an ad after every round that's twice as long as the round itself.,1
it's wasting our time. We played for mind relax but it's taking to watch the ads . 10 sec play 30 sec ads.,1
Meh. OK game but ads every 5 seconds ruins it,1
"I was watching the ad for this thinking it was pretty fun, I boot up the game and push play. The first thing I see is a God Damm ad. This game is nothing but ads",1
Just let me pay - I want to pay a small fee to play without seeing so many ads,1
"Dont bother, full of adverts, didnt get past level 1",1
Worst game ever Sooo many advertisements man I will not even give A Star to this game but to worn other to not download this game I had too so that I could write the review,1
Boring,1
"Would be fun, but there far to many ads in my opinion. Not shorts ads either after every level. It's a shame, could be fun. Uninstalled.",1
Too many ads,1
"For a 30 second level, there is a 30 second ad. Uninstalled after playing 5 levels. Don't waste your time guys",1
It's very lagging,1
There's an add every 15 seconds. This is more frustrating than it is fun or relaxing. Absolutely terrible!,1
Advertising hell.,1
This game is tati,1
Would rate a 0 if I could. 1 ad every single lvl,1
Waste of time,1
West game i give 0 stars,1
"Ad simulator, do not recommend",1
"Loooooong ads after every short game. Be smart, don't start.",1
Sw,1
To many ads,1
An advert per round is ridiculous. I saw it coming a mile off as well. Sick of getting duped by advert farms.,1
One 40 secs ad for each 5 secs level you play.,1
Really hate it there is glitches most of the time and I lost all of my progress,1
Game was fun. But even when you don't seeker to get more tokens they will make you watch ads. It's ads after every completion. It's almost like I need to file a me too movement on how aggressively forceful they are. I feel violated. Deleting. Not worth the ad harassment.,1
Literally an ad after every level,1
Too many ads.,1
"I am upset that one of the ""bad guy"" scenarios that are trying to beat up the running characters at the end of the race is a depiction of a police officer. Police serve to protect not mame individuals, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who was upset by this choice by the creators of the game.",1
"Annoying honestly, the entire app isn't even working in my honest opinion. I move left it goes right! I can't even get it to work after two minutes it kept crashing honestly these apps should be checked if they even work and not just money grabbing trash that shouldn't even be on here",1
Worst gaming experience. After every single match you have to face 30 second long advertisements 👎👎👎. 0 out of 10 experience,1
It was good at first but when the ads suddenly appearing the game was busted,1
"I've never seen so many ads in my life. Do yourself a favor and download something else. 30 seconds of game, 60 seconds of ads.",1
There is a game in your Ads,1
To many ads like every time you complete a level you get an ad,1
Terrible the ads are everywhere on youtube and if there was a feedback it could be useful i hope this game gets deleted and put 0 stars,1
You cant reach the top of the money doubler and it glitches sometimes when you wanna fight the archers,1
Insane a.ount of ads,1
Full of ads. Waste of time.,1
First few levels take 10 second or so and they force an ad between each one. I spent more time watching ads than playing the game.,1
Adds the game + count masters minigame. 50mins is basically 3 minutes of the game.,1
This game would be fun if but there are too many ads .it is frustrating,1
Non skipable 30+ second ads after a 5-10 second level. This isn't a game it's a book with a pop up game every few pages. So annoying. I don't mind watching ads to play a free game but game play time has to be greater than ad watching time for it to be worth the space on my phone.,1
"It really is a good game, but a 30 second ad between every level (which is about 10 seconds of gameplay) is not worth it.",1
Anxiety in 10 minutes just from all the ads!!! Waste of time..🤬,1
That's dull as.,1
Freefire is best not this,1
It so baf,1
Ads every level. Even got an ad for this game while playing this game.,1
Ads are unreal. Simple,1
Ad central,1
Bad app to much ads. Ads are bad. Game doesn't work as it should like i have 100 and i grab x10 and it just goes to 163 wth???? You can't learn anything from this and kids are gonna stop playing this and you are making lots of games and you will just spend money on ads for game I wanna give 0 stars :(,1
Way too many ads.,1
"There's so many ads it's basically unplayable, a level lasts maybe 10s and then a 30s ad ... Rinse and repeat ... I wanted an endless running game, this was just frustrating and boring.",1
Terrible. More ads than gameplay. Could've been a good game.,1
"Really easy, pointless coin collecting. Ads that take forever and a more frequent than the levels. Just a game to advertise other games.",1
Too many adds,1
ew,1
"Ads longer than the round after every single round? No thanks, what a horrible attempt at a cashgrab",1
Super,1
"The game is rigged. No matter how big your army is, you'll always get a maximum coin multiplier of x6.2",1
Worthless waste of time. With way too many ads,1
"Absolute garbage. It is basically one of those games that have no textures at all. It looked fun but all the levels are too short and the boss fights are lame, plus its loaded with ads",1
Too many ads,1
What is a reasonable waste of time game ruined by ads,1
"Way too many ads. I'll admit, I was instantly hooked, but after an ad after every single level and even some inbetween that for upgrades, it lost me wth in the first 10 to 15 minutes. Let me play more of the game before throwing a different game down my throat.",1
Many adds,1
The amount of ads in the game makes this game unplayable junk,1
You already kno,1
"I love watching ads, too bad they are constantly interuped with the gameplay.",1
I reached lvl. 20. Don't download this game it's boring and repetitive. It's waste of time!,1
Hussain110,1
To many ads,1
One word...AD'S,1
"There's an ad after every level. Not exaggerating - EVERY LEVEL. The levels are about 10 seconds long, so you're basically downloading an ad.",1
A lot of ads 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,1
"Fun for 10 minutes but the gems mean absolutely nothing, the building thing nothing, it completes after watching 8 ads and then just maxes at 1090 gems with nothing to do with them.. The game itself is just 8 maps or something on repeat.",1
"Ads are longer than gameplay. There is an ad after every level, and after every selection. Got through 4 levels and 6 ads. Uninstalled. Don't waste your time.",1
👎👎👎,1
This game has so many adds that you would end up hating it to the core! I wish I could give lesser than 1 star,1
Tooooo many announcements,1
This application has too many commercials it's unbearable,1
They deleted some of my amogus characters,1
This game is buggy & riddled with ads.,1
"Could've been a chill game, but it's 80% ads, just stupid",1
All this game is only ads!!!,1
Too many adds,1
"Really, they need to gather my data to play... don't waste your time with this app",1
"An ad after the literal first level, that lasted about thirty seconds? Followed by another ad after the second level? I spent more time on ads than playing the game. I'm fine with a game having ads but this is absurd. Shame too, because the gameplay was fun for the little bit I got to play.",1
Ads ads ads. Too many ads !,1
Too many ads,1
Ads,1
If you have ads problem you can close internet there will no ads nice game,1
Concept is great and I like the game but 15 seconds of play for a 10 second advert every level. Just no. 4.5 starts for the game. The adverts just kill it. I understand about advertising but every level you just killed the game. I played for 10 minutes and had to delete it.,1
It's OK. When it comes to getting ×5 diamonds it plays like 3 or 5 advertisements n it's alot of advertisements just playing the game. I've thought of uninstalling the game sometimes. Still may.,1
1 to 2 ads every level. And the levels are shorter than the ads. Ridiculous,1
Irritating,1
Literally playing a game for 11 seconds in between 30-second ads. Awful.,1
UNINSTALL. Way too many ads! Not fun for 5 seconds of game play🤬,1
Too many ads,1
Worst thing ever made. Boring layout. Ad ridden.,1
Would lag very badly as you gain more people. Riddled with adds even offline.,1
This game is ridiculous. Don't waste your time. You play one level. That takes like two seconds. And you get like to adds. I got far enough to start building my place and I have about 5 minutes of adds. One or two after each build. Delete game after two days,1
The game in and of itself is fun. The visual is nothing fancy but it's alright. But this is one of those brain damaged time killers with a long but mindless ad after every single level (and they're not that long). So yeah. It's nice that it's free but you'd have to pay me for my time if you wanted me to keep playing with the amount of ads in there.,1
"It's just ads. As for the gameplay: part of the draw for me is to ""make the right choice"" and build up a huge army, but the game is designed so you physically can't (ramps to get over things aren't wide enough for everyone, for example). I had the game installed for about 10 minutes and probably watched 7 minutes of ads.",1
"Could be a fun game, whole experience is ruined by ads. You will spend more time watching ads then playing the actual game.",1
Too many ads. In the first minute of gameplay I got 2 ads worth total 20 seconds. So 40% of gameplay is looking in ads,1
garbage,1
Too many ads appear when you complete a mission,1
Too much ads,1
The game kept lagging when trying to avoid obstacles and I ended up losing a ton of people.. it would have liked it if it didn't lag as much.,1
Way to many ads to even have a fun start experience,1
You'll spend more time watching ads than playing the game. That's not including banner ads during game play too.,1
Way way too many ads take them out and this game would be OK,1
"It's way too hard, I can't tell if I should get +5 people or +100 it's too difficult only legally skilled Harvard people can understand this game. Also, it appears they accidentally put some gameplay between their ads which I'm sure was just a mistake, because everybody downloads this just to watch the ads, right?",1
"Literally a ad after every level, plus ads if you want a skin that you EARNED.",1
The wait times within the ads are longer than the play time you get before you get another ad. Waste of time installing and trying to play.,1
You spend more time on ads than playing. Not worth it,1
Some levels are impossible the first time you try. So you are forced to watch another advert. I can't stress how many adverts there are. Some pages have the option to skip hidden or greyed out to make you think you need to click another video. Every level is sandwiched by at least one advert. The game is OK but nothing memorable,1
Way too many freaking ads!!!!,1
Ads are too much,1
"Basically what everyone else says: this is essentially a parasitic app that forces you to watch endless ads. The length of game play is almost equal to or shorter than the 30 second ads, sometimes two in a row, per every level (for context, a level takes about a 40ish seconds to beat.) Another disappointing thing about the game is that the map is of the US only. One would think it would move to other counties upon completion, but no. Beat it in a few hrs and uninstaled. Boooooring 🥱😴😴😴",1
too many ads and the game isnt even fun,1
Unistalled right after level 2 I understand free games always come with ads. But not 30 sec add after each level. Grow up ppl already If i could give 0 stars i would Dont download ppl its a waist of time and mbs,1
Wayyyy yo many ads,1
"Too many ads, the ads are after every round and last longer then the level you play. I am Uninstaller.",1
Bands gameeeee,1
Worst game eveeerrr!!!!,1
So many ads.,1
Qom,1
Ads after every level,1
"Not a bad game but ads last longer than gameplay, uninstalled.",1
"This isn't a game, it's an ad",1
Too many ads,1
Ratethisapp,1
"Adverts after every 10 seconds of game play....could have been a great time killer but 2 levels played, 2 adverts = game uninstalled. Appreciate its how you guys make money but ffs it's a joke",1
Any brightly colored 3d stickmen in a game is a automatic ad stimulator haven't played it but i know its bad,1
Full ads,1
This game is rigged. No matter how much you try you can never make it to the end of the stairs. There is also way to many ads. I'm done with this game.,1
"It's an awesome game, but there's to many adds.",1
Too many adds,1
Worst game....So many ads....You need to close the ads 3-4 times before you move to next stage.....,1
"Unbelievably full of glitches, I constantly losing because it lags and jumps. Terrible game.",1
Exactly what everyone else has said. There is an AD after every single level. After every single thing you do. It's completely ridiculous. For 10 seconds of game play. Not even worth it.,1
"Junk, can't play for 20 seconds without having to watch a 30 second ad.. Not Recommended!!",1
"Just awful, flooded with ads at every moment even with airplane mode on... Half decent game in principle ruined by over exploiting adds",1
kapal ng muka ng gumawa nito walang katapusan na adds kada isang games lagi my adds mukang pera,1
Too many ads,1
Just like everybody else is saying you don't have to put an ad after every single level that is longer than the level bad bad kind of cold it's bad kind of a cool game but you're just looking for money......,1
The ads are way too frequent.,1
Terrible cash graber can't enjoy because of adds only 2 minutes of play and add add adds everywhere,1
Ads after every very easy level,1
"Less then 15 seconds of game play, then 30 seconds of ads. EVERY level. I did 5 levels and it's a fun concept I could see myself playing but it's more than double ads to play time. Don't waste your time.",1
"You can play it in airplane mode, but not without.",1
"Total ad machine. 10 seconds of game time, then an ad. Decent game concept but too simple, to short, too many interuptions. I wish I could just hide everything from this dev so they'd stop wasting my time.",1
"If you love to watch ads, download it.",1
"I get the needs for ads, not when each round us less than 20 seconds tho",1
So bad,1
Way too many ads,1
More ads than game!,1
Game plays that's about it. Forced ads automatically equal 1 star.,1
sooooo many adds and lags quite a lot,1
It had way too many adds That just ruined my experience,1
this game is full of ads and it's annoying :))),1
Ad after ad after ad. And also app freeze in build screen.,1
Advert city,1
Spend more time on ads than game play.,1
Constant adverts. Boring.,1
More ads than game play,1
It's qate of time game.. Gameplay time is less than ads.,1
Commercial generator. Add after every 10 second puzzle.,1
"Nice game, however ugly adds 🤬",1
"Played the game for 1 round and was forced to watch an ad... Game is an ad cash grab. Uninstall, or better yet, don't ever install.",1
I have been working with the new job and you are the best and most likely 😗,1
Too many ads. Weak game. Dont bother.,1
Too many ads. Too many ads. Too many ads.,1
"Do not download, nothing but ads. Play for 15 seconds and then forced to watch 30 sec or longer ad, after every single level is completed.",1
I am the ceo of racism,1
This game gives me 100 adds to up a level for free it just says 1 add.,1
"The game is a decent time passer. But ads after EVERY level is ridiculous, takes 20 seconds to do a level, then minimum of 30 second ad. Uninstall",1
Spent more time watching ads than I did playing the game. Decrease your ad frequency and you might actually get someone to stick around to watch the ads,1
Bekar game,1
Great game if you like ads every 2 secs and no change in it what so ever highly DONT recommend it.,1
Trick To Watch adverts,1
Dreadful. Ads constantly,1
Too many advertisements..disturbing to play..,1
So many ads it's unplayable. I'd probably play it if I could pay money for no ads. Uninstalled.,1
I hate this game,1
Fun game but ads are unbearable. Litterally an ad every 30 seconds. Immediately uninstalled.,1
full of ads smh,1
Could maybe be fun if the ads weren't heinously long and terrible,1
Adds galore,1
Annoying Everything requires a ads even when I'm offline. Honestly one of the worst games I've ever played,1
Ads every single level,1
"Full of ads, ads, ads. Don't waste time by downloading this app.",1
"Too many ads...after every level played. The ads are longer than the actual game play. Not worth it and very annoying!!!! Gets boring after a few plays, repetitive and nothing to keep you interested in playing. Waste of time and space.",1
It's super easy for me,1
Like all the other reviews say. Ads and the other thing is it is pointless. There's no challenge to it at all.,1
Ad every 5 seconds,1
Annoying there's an add after each level,1
To many adds,1
"It was good at first, then it started glitching and made half of my screen rotate and then half of it just black.",1
To many adds,1
It takes very long to install so yeah,1
Downloaded and got to level three then multiple ads after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Fun game but horrible experience. Would not recommend to download.,1
Ad was gae,1
Another add farm,1
Full of ads You can't even play,1

Many ads...,1
Worst game ever too many ads don't download waste of time.,1
Too much add to play. Uninstalling. Dont waste your time plz,1
This game is just add skip simulator 2021,1
"Way way wayyy too many ads, you spend more time watching ads then the actual game play won't recommed.",1
"There is no way to keep all your guys. Always gain guys and instantly loose some with traps/obstacles. Has the same ad almost everytime you complete a level with no way to skip it. Want to mute it, can't do that either unless you mute your phone vloume. Very bad experience.",1
"Another ad filled, greedy dev, pos",1
Repetitive and spent more time watching adds than actually playing the game.,1
Reklam reklam reklam sürekli,1
Too many ads,1
"Hame was fun, add every 0.5 seconds",1
This game is waste,1
Too many ads,1
Rubbish boring game,1
Shouldn't be an ad after every game was fun though but I'm uninstalling it only get to play a portion of the game when I have time to play,1
Very boring and I am totally bored with ads very bas game😡😡🤬🤬🤬,1
Stupid ads at the end of EVERY level make this game impossible to enjoy,1
Hello good,1
Fun game. Ads are too much not worth it for me,1
Bloody ads then you get more ads then ads again Don't waste your time in this game,1
"Ads after every 5 second round, game ruins itself don't install",1
The game is designed in such a way that if ads won't load means you are offline or by an case internet not working then you can move to next step beacause your ads won't work. This is really pathetic 😠 😡 👿,1
"laggy, too many ads, and not very entertaining.",1
"Dont really want to give a 1 star but this game is ridiculous. Collect up to 300 little people then you go through 2 obstacles and you've lost pretty much the entire gang. Not to mention as you ""level"" up your paying $3000 / $7000 for 1 person. Thats crazy! You'd think you pay that much and receive about 10 people if your going to lose them all by the end of the round. And you pay for your end cost that only goes up about $10. This game wasnt thought through in the making. Bring the prices down",1
Adsssss,1
So 👎9,1
Unplayable. Video ads every 5 seconds. Immediately uninstalled.,1
The shortest levels I've ever played followed by long ads after every flipping level!,1
Too many ads if somebody gave it five stars then it's a fake review,1
Trash app by trash company,1
"Can I PLEASE pay you to remove the ads?!??! I've timed it, I spend more time watching ads than I do playing the delightful little game you've created. It sucks and makes me hate the game.",1
Too many long ads after every level and levels are smler than adds.,1
To many adds,1
Plz delet this app,1
Too many ads,1
Guys do you want a game where ads play every second we'll get this one run and get a ad also super laggy plus graphics suck,1
too many ads.,1
Too many ads.,1
Ad after EVERYTHING!!!!!!!,1
A good game but it crashes every 1 min. and you are forced to watch an ad every round.,1
"It's a fun little game, but way too many ads.",1
Ads are poping out Even with the internet data closed... Ads are so disturbing... Does not even deserve 1 star but sadly there is no lower option. Removes ads and it become interesting for leisure.,1
"Ads for every action, damn",1
"An ok game but to many gosh damn ads every level ad, open a box ad, tried to skip an add by just clicking go to next level and it forced me into an ad if you just wanna watch ads all day this is the game for you then , also gems do nothing at all in the game had 4000 gems and couldn't even buy anything with it",1
"If you want 90% Ads and 10% Gameplay, get this game. Not only do you have to suffer through at least 2 or 3 intrusive ads in the middle of a level and at the end, you also need to claim mandatory rewards and build structures by watching more ads just so you can progress. Download at your own risk. You may be absolutely bored to death.",1
Outrageous ads. Less than 15s of gameplay followed by 45+ second of ads. Each ad needs 3 screens to clear.,1
"Average gameplay. Same as every game in this error. Ciuld do better on unity by myself poor graphuc, collision, etc",1
Too many ads. Ad after every level and in between,1
It's spams you on others apps and paids people to be stooped like to choose 10 instead 100.,1
Impossible to get over 150,1
There are way too many unnecessary ads after every round.,1
There are way too many ads after each level one after each level.,1
The game was fun until the company obviously sold out and stuck an ad after every single level. I have crypto card memorized now!,1
Hope you like adds.......,1
"WAY to many adds, the game itself is fun, but not worth the amount of adds.",1
No thank you,1
too many ads,1
Too many ads.. Uninstalled,1
Too much ads.,1
The amount of times the game froze and i had to reopen it is driving me insane. I'll survive without this game,1
"Constant ads. Game has ~ten seconds levels and shows you a 30+ second ad after every one. You want this skin? Watch this ad. No? You could skip and lose the skin. Ok great... now, watch this ad before the next level. I played the game for at most five minutes and 60-80% of that time was in ads. Uninstalled extremely fast.",1
Romer Abel Arendain,1
"More ADs than content, don't waste your time",1
"The games badly made allthroughout, making a nice idea terrible by putting in minimal effort, also the amount of adverts is pretty ridiculous, can't even play one round ( if you could even call that a round ) ,before it plays 1-3 adverts nonstop, tried turning off WiFi to stop this yet a new update has made WiFi required to play. It's a game made for money and nothing else, don't recommend at all.",1
Bad,1
Is a fun game just every 5 seconds there's a ad. They need to either need to have a way to remove them. And or make the time between ads longer,1
Bad,1
Too many ads,1
I dont like this vame bc it lag,1
Support game 😃,1
More ads than play. Waste of time.,1
"Too many adds and it's just another bad mobile game, not worth it. I miss the good mobile games from the early 2010's",1
The game is good sample is for you,1
"Horrible, can max out your island in like 25 or 30 minutes, then you collect gems that do nothing, all the play the same, there is no goals and if you decline to watch a video to not get a bonus after a level it just plays an ad anyhow. One the least enjoyable things ive played in a bit 1/10 max",1
So irritating so many ads...,1
Way too many ads!,1
Ads after every level. More time spent waiting for ads than actually playing the game.,1
"Way to many adds, impossible to actually play. This is spam",1
To many ads,1
Ad every level. Unoriginal lazy app as usual. This stuff is so bland it hurts to see.,1
Too bad,1
PLAY WITH WIFI OFF! Ads after every level! The ads lie you NEVER see a multiplier above x6 and you will rarely get above 300 guys. Gameplay would be okay if it wasn't ruined by the MANY sections where they limit your size. Doesn't feel rewarding to get a large group and then lose most of it to an impossible section.. Many small bugs which collaborate to make a very janky experience. The performance is bad. Overall just avoid this game. If you do want to play it or try it out play with WiFi off.,1
too many ads,1
"Nice game, but the ads. Why ? So annoying. It just ruins the game. Zero stars if I could.",1
Far too many ads and they're all very long!,1
"10 second game, 30 second advertisement. Rince and repeat.",1
WAY too many ads,1
"It has a ton of adds,even if you stop your internet on the phone it will still try and open your browser!",1
To many ads,1
Game froze and couldn't progress. Uninstalled. Requires a lot of stability mechanics improvements. Interesting but kinda elementary.,1
You spend more time watching commercials than actually playing it.,1
"This game is not fun. Ads around every corner and you can feel the capitalist creators of this game's lust for money oozing off of it. Even if you turn your internet off, it's not a good game.",1
2 ez maths class is harder lol (I'm on 2nd grade lol xD owo),1
Long ad every level. Instant uninstall.,1
To mu ads,1
Too many ads,1
At least let me pay to not get ads all the time,1
"I wish i could give it 0 you already know the reason, too many ads",1
"Levels last 15 seconds max, after every level completed you have to watch a 45sec add.",1
"10 seconds play, 10 minutes ads",1
So Bad,1
"A shallow game, fun for about five minutes if you have the internet turned off to avoid the constant ads",1
Adds,1
"So much ADS, so much lies.",1
Too much ads!! Game is too short. You'll spend a lot more time watching ads than playing,1
An ad after every single round! One little round is less than 10 seconds and every ad is at least 30 seconds! It's too bad because the actual game would be super fun if you could play it for more than half a second at a time!,1
I love it,1
You will spend more time watching ads than playing the game. A level lasts 20-30 seconds and so does the add you watch every time after. Unplayable.,1
"Need option to pay for ad free, would be all I played then!!",1
Add ads ads and there is no objective,1
Its a stupid game,1
😑👎👎👎👎👎,1
Guys did you even try..,1
Way to many ads and not enough interesting aspects of the game to make me want to continue playing it. Many people have complained. Time to listen to the people who actually want to play the game.,1
A very very bad Ad game 👎,1
"So bad , much ads",1
Tooooooooooo many ads what a waste,1
Ad central. What a disgrace,1
Game freezes,1
"Cheap, badly done app.",1
"Levels take 10 seconds to finish, way too easy, TONS OF ADS, you spend most of the time watching ads",1
Wont load,1
this game is piece of shi*,1
it's so laggy. and the ads. omg. the ads suck.,1
Too many ads. Not fun with so many pop ups,1
Boring,1
"WAY TOO MANY ADS, YOU PLAY A LEVEL FOR 5 SECONDS AND THEN HAVE TO WATCH A 30 SECOND AD EVERYTIME! SO ANNOYING",1
Adds ... too many Adds....it is a shame so many Adds,1
I have to say that the game is fun but there is no sound to this game which makes it no fun if I can rate this it would be a zero,1
More ads than actual game time. Waste of an app.,1
Рекламна параша,1
"Well first of all, A D S like bro if you wanted to make a good game then dont focus on ad revenue/money but work on making people happy to play it. And last of all if you have alot of guys you can see at the end after 6.08 you can see there is a end. I dont belive you can get to it. So it wants you to play it so bad. Anyways ripoff remake of good games.",1
This game sucks,1
only ads.. I wamt to continue without extra diamonds but this game doesnt let me to..,1
Adds,1
Fake game,1
"I hate the game because of ads, let's us have choice to pay to remove ads",1
"Inhale, ad, exhale, ad, blink, ad, think, ad, ad, ad, another ad. Another game with a great idea but just plain sucks because of ads. Not worth it in the least. Total crapfest.",1
Nice game,1
Lmao,1
EXTREMELY LAG!,1
"Dalsi sracka na reklamy, desny!!!",1
Not even game to justify the deluge of ads.,1
Garbage,1
Made it through two stages and spent more time watching ads than playing. Maybe there's fun to be had with this one but the developers definitely don't want you to enjoy it.,1
Ads aids,1
"How many adds you're willing to watch is how good you are at this game, awful.",1
Good game FULL OF ADDS 😡😡😡😡😡,1
Ad after every level. Piss poor,1
Game levels time is less add time is more.,1
Junk,1
Waste game in the world,1
Just ads nothing of a game,1
"An add every level? 10 seconds of play time, 30 second add? Will never play any game from this company ever again. Wish incould give zero stars.",1
Poopoooooo,1
10 seconds of play then thirty seconds of ads. Just to much to tolerate.,1
It lags a lot,1
Too many ads ruins my enjoyment of the game. Will uninstall.,1
Game is good ..but i uninstalled because there is lot of advertisement,1
"Sorry, but I'm not watching an ad every 30 second of gameplay",1
Can't silence the ads which appear at each stage and are interminable. Occasional ads are acceptable. At the end of everystage? They are longer than the game play! If you can't mute them... I don't watch and just delete.,1
Way to many ads to be fun. Uninstalled,1
Laggy,1
Three ads after incredibly short levels. This is barely a game. Uninstalled after less than 5 minutes.,1
I really think you need more ads! 😳,1
Omg the ads!!! More time watching ads than playing game. Uninstalled after 5 levels,1
Literally the max amount of ads they could fit.,1
It won't let me play it the most stupidest game ever,1
Kinda good but loads of adds,1
Plenty of Ads,1
This game is fun and addictive but the ongoing ads every other game?! Games last less than a minute each and I'm supposed to watch a add every two? Come on guys.... greedy too much or what?,1
We are here to play the game. Not to watch the ads. So many ads.,1
This game is full of ads and it's so slow. It doesn't even look like a decent game. Kinda scary to play because of the ads that makes me visit another scam website.,1
Ads extremely more than to be acceptable,1
the amount of ads in this game before you even finish the round theres an ad the second you finish the round theres an ad. I DONT RECOMMEND.,1
More ads than playing.,1
"Alright game, but the ads are a bit ridiculous.. 5 seconds of game play, 30 seconds of ads. Ad after every round... wouldn't bother downloading.. 7ads in less then 3 mins of having it downloaded.. removed it from the phone just as quickly as it was downloaded.",1
Ads every 5s,1
Ad do something ad do something ad do something ad do something. Forever,1
No opt out of ads. Ad every game.,1
The ads run for longer than each level of the game and play between every level making this whole thing impossible to tolerate.,1
Too many ads. Got fed up as ads were longer than each level,1
Ok game,1
"Borring, all levels are almost the same, no real counting chalange, you become like ""more powerfull"" if you start to spend money on loots, it's rude how many ads there are, and not just some usual ads, but those long and unskipable ones... I just hope no one will actually waste their 30 minutes of life as I did, there is litterally anything that is better to do than to play this game, I am giving it one star in hope that it's going to hurt feelings of the person who made that game...",1
To many ads,1
Adds and adds and more adds nothing else...,1
Ads Ads 5 seconds of gameplay... 35 seconds of ads. Happened on my first two levels and uninstalled it right after.,1
Too many ads. Ads after every level. No fun.,1
Honestly boring,1
"More adverts than game, rubbish!",1
This games is not good as I espect so if you want to watch add then download this app soo only 1 🌟,1
Ads after every damn level! About 50/50 share of ads vs gametime,1
"The game itself is fun, but the full page 30 second ads after every single level were so annoying I uninstalled the game.",1
Absolutely terrible with ads the ad is longer than the level pathetic,1
"It's not a game it's pure advertisement, nothing else, don't get fooled",1
the advertisements in this game are horrible. every damn level.,1
This has alot of adds 😠 and it goes of after the add is done.,1
It is boaring,1
You guys can't bear a bigNumber of guys always brings a trap I am uninstalling this stupid game,1
Extreme number of ads. Way to many. After each short level. Absurd. Uninstalling.,1
10 seconds of game play followed by 30 seconds of advertising is quite annoying. I realized the game makes it money via the adds but it would be nice if ther was a little more game play between ads.,1
You need better intetnet,1
Too many ads,1
Add problem,1
Ad after every level when levels are less than the ads themselves. Bad practice from devs,1
"Terrible, don't even waste your time. Ads everytime. Terrível, nem perca tempo. Anúncios o tempo todo.",1
May I should tell you about the app which removes ads and have mod of games it can download paid games in free also the application you can download from googel app name tutu app thank you .,1
Too many ads.,1
"""what's the laziest, cheapest way we can make a game to riddle with ads?"" Only downloaded because their ad in other games forces the store open. Just wanted to leave this review.",1
I would give this a game a 0 star if possible. You watch more ads than playing the actual game. This would have been a great game if it wasn't for the ads and the fact that it is very repetitive. No challenge at all.,1
Can be a good game but to much ad,1
"Terrible game, barely responsive and slow as a Corpse.",1
add,1
Too many ads to be able to test the game out.,1
Way too many ads,1
Ads take longer than the game,1
Ads are longer than the game,1
Very boring concept,1
Dogshit game.,1
Bad game,1
Just a non stop series of ads on every level,1
Ads galore,1
Tooooo much ads,1
Sucks,1
Far too many ads to be playable. More ads than game.,1
ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS & MORE ADS ADS ADS....NICE GAdsMe Tho,1
"The game is ok. There are commercials after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL... it's the most annoying thing. I had remove it, it became frustrating",1
Wish i could give 0 stars based on game being ridiculously saturated with adds. Was waiting for an add to pop up while watching an add. Ridiculous. Had potential to be a good time waster. Shame on the greedy developers. UNINSTALLED.,1
Far too many adds.,1
चीन वालों तुम्हारी मां का भोंसड़ा 😡😡,1
It's game is so ad. 😠,1
"A game with SO much Playability, Ruined by a never ending plethora of AD WALLS! completing a level takes under 10 seconds, then you get an irritating ad wall for 12 seconds. Don't waste your time or your data on this, it's just an ad generator.",1
40 seconds of commercials for 20 seconds of play....,1
Too many ads,1
More ads than gameplay. Would not reccomend.,1
Boring,1
More ads than gameplay,1
Vaibhav,1
It's stupid,1
Worst game,1
Is this is a game then i am the AD,1
This is 🗑,1
The ads get unbearable (and 30 second unskipable) after level 6. Would not recommend to anybody.,1
Literally just a vehicle to show you adds,1
Adds every second. Developers cear more about profits then game play and it shows,1
To many ads!,1
A D S,1
Totally waste app dont install it waste app .🙏🙏,1
Adds every 10 secounds,1
It is just very bad,1
10 second level 30 second and no fun,1
Adverts every 10 seconds. Game lagged and crashed.,1
"Ads ads and ads...too much is just too much...levels are shorter that ads... orher than that,game is pretty much ok.but aftet 10 levels i just gave up,ads are too annoying!",1
One lvl finished one ad. One lvl finished one ad. You watch more ads than playing this game.. uninstalled..,1
Too many ads.,1
Why bother,1
10 seconds of game play followed by 10 minutes of adverts,1
To many adds,1
"It's a fun game, but there's an ad after every single level...I can't stand games that overdo the ads... I don't mind an ad every few levels, but every single one is too much.",1
Ad ridden nonsense. Don't play.,1
This game is great but at every sexion you past there's an ad what makes the game really enjoying and boring sow your ads Jesus 😒,1
It has so more adds than every other games and the game freeze every time,1
Too many ads and that's disgusting!,1
"You spend More time watching ads than you do getting to play the game.... can't even pay to remove ads.... as Randy would say ""It's a no from me dawg""",1
"Way too many ads, 2/3 of the game is watching ads. Levels are all pretty much the same, no increase in difficulty or duration. Upgrades make little to no difference as the more units you have, the more you lose to obstacles. Even without ads, there is nothing much to the game. Unless major improvements are made, it's not even worth the download, let alone paying for it.",1
You'll literally spend more time watching and than playing... Not worth it,1
I hate diss game😡,1
Ad after ad after ad after ad. There's more ads than actual game.,1
Fully lag game 😠😠😠😠,1
"Ads every menu press, lasted about 10 minutes, could of been such a good game",1
To many adds,1
Min left ng ads between each level..no thanks,1
Too much ads,1
Literally more ads than game,1
"This game is bad. It's filled to the bone with ads. Every level ad, every time you upgrade ad. Even without the ads it would still be bad. One of the biggest issues is how the game is designed. It's designed in such a way where it feels like your units are capped because of their bad group path they do. Even if I play perfectly, I'll have 2/3rds of my units die just from randomly placed holes or saw blades for reasons.",1
Half time playing it is just ads,1
too many ads,1
Stupid people on ads,1
Worst,1
Ads. That's what you get.,1
Too many ads. I am fadeup,1
Too many ADS 😤,1
Full of adds,1
When you have over 150 stick figure guys the game start wagging and the lag is so dogsh*t.,1
"5 seconds of game play, 20 secondas of adds. Repeat.",1
"Toilet game. Good for when you're having a poo. Too many ads, with at least 2 different providers. 10s of play and then a 30s video. No thanks.",1
30 second of play followed by 60 seconds of adverts. Uninstalled.,1
Freezes and glitches slot. Can never finish a game without it crashing. Spend more time watching adds,1
Not letting me download i will give a 5 rate us i played the game,1
This game is awful. I swear the way it glitches is intentional to cause seizures. Don't play,1
Played it for about 5 minutes and watched about 15 minutes of averts for the privilege. There might be quite a good game buried under the ad delivery but it's just not worth it.,1
Ads straight away . More ads than time to play . Deleted,1
"5 sec level, 30 sec ad, extremely boring on top of that",1
"Each level takes around 10 secs and when you want to start enjoying the game, it ends! Then you have to view adds for more than 15 secounds on EACH level! Ridiculous! Uninstalled after 5minutes.",1
Super glitchy. Mine frooze in the first minute of download.,1
Fake ratings. Watch multiple adds every minute to play the game!,1
This Game Don't Have sounds when I play please fix it I have problems this Game there no sounds when I play it,1
Cool game but WAY too many adds,1
Good game concept but ads after ads after ads. So boring. AND THERE IS STILL ADS WITH NO INTERNET,1
Won't play,1
"Looks like a super fun game, had too many ads to play.",1
If I could give zero Stars I would of bombardment of ads all it is,1
"So irritating, too much Adds",1
Too many interruptions,1
Rip off of other better games and not done especially well. Controls are very annoying.,1
"Play for 5 seconds, watch a 20 second ad after ever single game. It would be good with less ad's.",1
Too many ads,1
Way to many ads. Spend more time watching them then playing the game,1
This game was ultimate trash. The game was laggy and buggy and their is a ad every time after a level. I would not recommend this to anyone.,1
90 percent adds 10 percent game play,1
So many adds,1
Ads. Like come on just killing your own game...,1
Ads are ridiculous,1
Aaab,1
too much ads.,1
GAME FOR ADS,1
Pathetic amount of ads,1
Ads ads ads ads STOP!!!,1
"Absolutely disgusting intrusive ads! Developers, you are dispicable and should be ashamed of your greedy money hungry selves! I STRONGLY advise anyone who thinks about downloading this pile of ad garbage! It's a complete waste of time.",1
Ads... Ads... Ads...,1
endless ads,1
What is the go with the little village thingy? I don't understand it at all..,1
Obnoxious. You play a 10 second level and must watch or sit through a 30 second ad. Every level? Seriously? What a short sighted decision. Fun concept though. But absolutely garbage experience delivery.,1
the ad is so much,1
All ads,1
There is an ad after each level and the level is about 5 seconds long. Seriously this game is made of ads and has a little bit of gameplay in it. I uninstalled after playing 4 levels.,1
Too many ads. Like all the time,1
An ad after every turn?,1
Boring game. After each level you have to watch an ad longer than the actual level.,1
Too much advertising,1
Way too many adds.,1
"Ads, Ads, and more Ads....Ugghhh",1
package never arrived and I'm being asked to ask to grade it,1
very bad its laging and so much ads,1
Literally not a game. No thought or challenge; just ads.,1
To much ads 😑,1
"1. Extreme touch sensitivity. Makes wining the game more difficult, which wouldn't be a problem if it actually made sense. 2. Literally more Ads than gameplay. Each level is only a few seconds long, and then you get ads that are about equally as long in between. You also get prizes, but only if you watch an even longer ad. And if you chose to skip the prize, you still gotta watch one. 3. Extremely glitchy and laggy, which also makes the game more difficult. Sometimes it won't work at all",1
Avoid.,1
Ads annoying,1
Way too many ads. Ruins th game 😓,1
Too many ads,1
Far too many ads. Literally one after EVERY level.,1
It is not good it is like a rip of game,1
Fun game? Maybe? So many ads. Just way too many. Also the boss battle away bar is incredibly inaccurate. Not worth until they stop putting ads after ever 30 second level.,1
Good game,1
Ads ads ads ads,1
"you are not installing this game to have fun, you're only installing it to watch ads... 🥴",1
Waste game I have ever seen,1
"To many ads, waste of time",1
After every levele you have to watch a 30 seconds commercial. It is very annoying and kills all the fun...,1
"Meh, ad money maker. For them. Each level is very simple, graphics are simple. I guess they use this to get some revenue in while working on other games.",1
Super,1
TOO MUCH ADS,1
"The game is just a recycled formula hat exists just to farm ads. The ads appear after every round is completed, the game is overall boring and repetitive. There is nothing original about it.",1
Way too many ads,1
Bad,1
Jihad,1
"Play a level, watch an ad, play a level, watch an ad, and then you play a level and watch an ad!",1
Totally worst game ! Contains too many ads after completing level.,1
Lame Game,1
"Too many ads. Basically, after every level there's an ad. Plus, no exit option. If I could put zero, I would. Uninstalled after 10 mins.",1
Way way too many ads,1
Could be enjoyable if after every 10 second level you didn't have to suffer an advert. The youtube advert I downloaded this game because of is 5x longer than the amount of time I have played and I've had to watch 3 adverts tue advert didnt have adverts in it... I'm sick to death of these games with adverts every 10seconds.,1
هنگیه,1
"Too many adverts. It seemed as though I spent 10% of my time on this app playing and 90% watching adverts. Sorry, but life is too short.",1
One game is about 30 seconds and after every single game there is a 30 second ad. It's ridiculous. Not worth it.,1
Count masters,1
It won't let me download,1
"Too many ads. Pretty ridiculous, tbh...",1
LOTS OF ADS EVERY LEVEL THERE IS 4 ADS PLAYING EVERY TIME I TAP SOMEWY ON SCREEN,1
"Boring game, ads after every level.",1
I spent twice as long watching the ads then actually playing the game.,1
Played till I couldn't take the ADS! Time is equal divided between game & ads.. For me it's a no.,1
Way too many adds,1
"Repetitive, never challenging, utterly pointless.",1
"5% actual game play, 95% ads. Don't waste your time.",1
Game with the most stupid idea ever and designed to force you to watch ads,1
"The game is slow, has too many ads and always lags. Fix it, please!",1
Money grab. Ads on everything you try to do. Please do not download and put more money into their pockets. Total greed. Deleted 2 minutes into it.,1
All ads.,1
"Way too many adds to enjoy before one buys. Pass a level, watch two ads. Die then watch an ad to restart...I pass",1
"Horrible, more ads than gameplay, let us buy an ad free version!!!",1
"If you like watching ads every minute, this game is for you. C'mon... NOBODY LIKES WATCHING ADS!!!",1
Nothing but an ad serving mechanism. The game might be fun if it didn't spend more than half the time playing ads.,1
Too many ads! Will destroy your ph. Do not download this game.,1
"Uma propaganda a cada level, impossível jogar.",1
"There is an ad after every level very annoying, made me decide to uninstall",1
"In less than 3 minutes, I had to watch 2 adds! What did I think to install it:/",1
DO NOT WASTE TIME ITS SPAM Ad after ad and the game doesnt progress just repeats so you watch more ads to fill their pockets,1
Ive never seen SO many ads in a game ever lol its like you play for 15 seconds and have to watch 45 seconds worth of ads.,1
More ads than can be justified by the simplistic gameplay. Avoid.,1
You can not even play a simple game without it showing bunch of ads.,1
"Game play is fine - not at all unique, but solid. However ad content is overwhelming. 10 seconds of play and then a 30 second ad. After five levels of this nonsense I am uninstalling. I'll find a similar game that is less of a waste of my time. Avoid.",1
Not nice,1
Ads app,1
Has a lot of ads,1
Lots and lots of ads,1
The amount of ads are out right frustrating. More ads then game time. Not gonna bother keeping this game!,1
The ads won't let me to play 😒,1
"It's not a game, you are just downloading some advertisement application. 🖕",1
Too many ads. It's annoying!,1
"Very worst game, playtime in 5secs and advt time in 10 secs. For every stage one add.. don't install this game.. waste of data....",1
Trash ad game,1
"Neat concept but WAY WAY WAY too many ads. Every little thing you click on, or level completed (which are about 10 seconds long) is followed by a 30 to 45 second Ad. Will be deleting this app.",1
Stupid game Ads every 5-10secs Design to keep your kids/baby busy while racking up ads,1
Too many ads. Play a short level watch an ad each time. Sorry not a fan.,1
Ads! Ads! Ads! 😡,1
Une pub à chaque partie... App désinstallée au bout de deux = 2 minutes de jeux.,1
"Boring, notch else I can say had it for less than a day and uninstalled",1
Oh man! too much ads. This game is good but it shows ads every second and that also two to three ads at one time. So annoying.,1
Ads after every level and the Ads run longer then the levels last absolute trash,1
EFgn c,1
After every level is a advert is ridiculous,1
Bad boring game,1
"Awful, adverts last longer than the levels",1
CountMaster,1
This game is not amazing yet,1
Ad after every round is almost more ad than game,1
"Would be a interesting game to keep playing. BUT adverts after each level. Sorry, but I want to play not earn you money for watching adverts for games on Google Play.",1
Basically an excuse to watch ads,1
1 star because every round you have to watch an ad. Pathetic,1
"Just a shameless ad machine. It has about as much content as watching TV and changing between the channels to watch commercials on different stations. The ads on this game are seriously longer than the levels, and take multiple clicks to close.",1
Ad simulator,1
I really don't like this its so glitches so meny ads,1
Only advertisment,1
Loosing my time with adverts. I arrived on high level and nothing is changing. Trash game ever. Uninstall after few days,1
Too many ads. Makes the game boring.,1
Literally an ad after every level and everything else!,1
I don't mind ads...but to play for 5 seconds and then have to watch a 30 second ad? I didn't mind the first couple levels....but its just too much.,1
The worst,1
Too many ads my time is more valuable than 30s of playing 1min of ads.,1
I keep seeing the same app and it won't stop doing it,1
Ads ads ads long ads long ads,1
Too many ads.,1
I DON'T PLAY FOR ADS,1
"I'm up to level 1800 and have finally accrued enough men at the beginning to always end up with 200+ men at the end. The problem is, you, you will never get above the 6.2x bonus for money. I once had 400 men at the end and when I crossed the finish line, it bumped me down to 250 and only gave me 6.2x bonus. It obviously goes higher, so why cap out there? Also... tons of ads, but I just close the app and restart it. Saves a BUNCH of time.",1
The game itself is fun. But youre spending more time watching ads than actually playing the game. Deleted it after 10 minutes,1
Anಜಜಚಝಃ,1
Adds adds F..k how many adds,1
Pérdida de tiempo,1
waste of my time,1
Wayyyy too many adds,1
"I wouldn't have a problem with this game if it didn't rig you for failure, and force you to gamble mid game. This is clearly designed as a half assed cash grab as it lacks audio and badgers you to watch ads, unless you have literally nothing better you could be doing, such as watching TV, do not grab this game.",1
Don't waste your time with this game! It is full of ads with no skip option! You end up with 15 sec playing and 30 sec of ads after each level. I understand the devalopers need to make money but not like this. It is disgusting!,1
Ttt,1
Pretty much just adverts. Deleted after the first five levels.,1
Too many ads. You play for 10 seconds watch 1 min ad. Rinse and repeat.,1
"Adware, bloatware, made for people with IQ<50",1
"I was OK with this game up until the part where my little gobblins are attacking a police officer, screw you and your warped mentality.",1
Waste of the and data,1
Really bad because it's laggy,1
Too many adds obnoxious ones too,1
using the word promise Wallop app is f*****,1
Boring 🙄,1
So many ads- more ads than gameplay. Deleted,1
hate game 🌰,1
The simplicity of the game is undermined by the level of advertising between each level.,1
"Very boring game. No matter how high you get your crowd to, the game just has obstacles in the way where even if you play perfectly, your crowd get diminished to around the same number each round. The extra game mode where you attack parts of the country/region is even worse. The game literally tells you how to play it. And to make matters worse, once you finish zone 4 you don't get the reward! The progress bar just stays at 80% (ish) percent full! Not to mention the continuous and mandatory ads",1
"Ads, ads everywhere",1
Too many dick 😂,1
"It could be a super fun game but give me a break, man! There's an ad after EVERY Level, sometimes you can't skip it and you have to watch it in full length. The levels are shorter to play than to watch the ads. Honestly, I don't want to download a game to get other games proposed every minute. That's what I call click bait. It's ridiculous and annoying...",1
It's basically a load of ads with an occasional game thrown in every so often,1
Trouble it on starting makers are not making the hard levels,1
Ads,1
An ad after every single action without exception. Miserable experience.,1
Fun game if it wasn't for the ads after every level,1
"Has potential but overall isn't worth it. I ""finished"" the game in less than 24 hours (got all the skins and ""built"" my island). Wasn't much point in playing after that. Also too many ads; though this can be avoided for the most part if you turn your wifi off.",1
"Even worse than I imagined, and I had very low expectations to begin with",1
"To many adds to actually enjoy the game. It's a fun game, but an add every 30 seconds destroys all fun. You will spend more time watching adds then playing the game.",1
Fun but way to many ads,1
WAY too many ads!,1
Bekar ekdam,1
"Why are there so many inskippable ads, dont you people understand gameplay? 10 second game 30 sec add. Thats not right. You should be ashamed.",1
"More ads than game. This is an ad every level game, but the levels are shorter than the adverts. Which is annoying as it would be a nice relaxing game. Also if you reject the reward/bonus because you don't want another advert, you still get an advert.",1
The game is gloryfied ads! Pushing ads in your face on every level and to get skins. If you spend 10min playing you get 8mins of which waiting for ads.,1
It would be a great game if it stake for the 30 second ads every 20 seconds.,1
I down loaded This and Uninstalled it before opening it Because of all the complaints of too many ads I hate ads Don't mind a few but come on guys,1
Very bad game,1
So glitchy. Unplayable,1
"By far this is my most fastest app i ever uninstalled in my life! YOU'LL SPEND MORE TIME IN ADS COMPARED TO PLAYING IT. THIS GAME SHOULD BE RENAMED "" COUNT ADVERTISEMENTS"" Just wasted my phone memory.",1
"ads, ads, ads, reclame, full of ads, delete!",1
"BEST MOBILE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, SHOULD BE ON PC AND CONSOLE!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😭",1
"Nice game, TONS of ads",1
I don't want watch ads,1
Too many ads,1
Too many unskippable ads,1
Joke of a game... far too many adds. You're made to watch one after each level. AVOID!!!!,1
Too many ads,1
👍,1
"Way too many ads, gets on ya nerves.",1
Worst and the worst,1
I understand having ads to finance production but ads that are longer than the levels and an ad after every single level? No thanks. I uninstalled after 6 levels.,1
Should have put more game in with the adds,1
"money hungry people, way too much ads, it should be called an app specifically for showing ads, which occasionally rarely pops up a playable environment which one can call a game.",1
Very laggy,1
"This is very bad game don, t install the game very fake game",1
It's boooorrrrrriiiiiinnnggg,1
"Wow what a bore, I've had more fun clipping my toe nails than playing this game.",1
To much adverts annoying,1
"Atrocious. Ads after every single action. Don't download, don't waste your time.",1
Ad after every 3 second level. Not worth it.,1
its not fun,1
Terrible annoying ads after every stage. If you want to have any money from this game this is not very good decision to throw in the face tons of ads.,1
So bad👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,1
Just a way to show you ads,1
Horrible game. There is adds between every level and it is super laggy and glitchy. DO NOT PLAY.,1
"Ads Ads Ads ads ads ads ads aids ads ads, oops did I say aids?",1
It's a nice game but get suck while playing it each moment...please kindly work on it,1
One level = one add. Level os about 10 seconds ads is 15 seconds. Ads on bottom of the screen. Rally? Are you nuts? Not playable because of ads,1
Playd 2 lvl and had to wach 6 ads in the span of 3min gameplay less then 20sec 0/10 not ewen worth the one star do not play unless you wanna waist your life waching ads,1
Insane amount of ad,1
Worst game,1
Unplayable because of ads,1
⚰️,1
Endless ads after you play every level in 8 seconds,1
Boring,1
Too many ads.. ads ads and more bloody ads...and then...yup more ads... Finished game too quickly..no progression and play is too easy. This could have been good... But no...,1
"Lasted 5 minutes to many adds,",1
"To many commercial vs play time, not much fun and deleted after a couple days.",1
It really get very laggy. And also ads.,1
Would love an ad free version of this game!,1
"Like others said, game is what it says, but there's ads after each level, not just to get bonuses. Only marketers think these games are worth publishing.",1
Not worth the time to install because of the unreasonable number of ads.,1
"Binapani,",1
Make ads where you actually win it makes me disappointed,1
putangina mo ng nag lalaro Gago Putangina ng naglalaro ng laro na ganto sa tiktok inutil ampota,1
To many ads,1
"Too many ads, one after each level is annoying",1
Advert after every level. Please avoid.,1
Nothing but ads,1
Too many ads,1
Holy carp way to many ads.,1
Ads are longer than gameplay.,1
Ad City,1
Too many ads,1
This is really bad Please don't download it Because when I reach level 3 And complete level 3 it automatically paused this is very awful game,1
You spend just as much time playing the game as you do watching ads not worth playing,1
"Who doesn't like a mediocre repetative game between inescapable full screen adverts? 🤔 Played it for a while with airplane mode enabled, that does stop the adverts, which is the driving force behind this and similar games. ADVERTS ADVERTS ADVERTS! I uninstalled the game because it gets boring really quickly and did I mention, there's way too many adverts to be enjoyable! 😡",1
Waiter? There is some game in my advertisements!,1
Waste more time spent on commercials than game. SKIP,1
Full of advertise!,1
The most ad-riddled experience I've ever seen. Play a ten second level - ad. Get a reward - ad. Play a ten second level - ad. Ridiculous.,1
What a game this is wow!,1
Good game if you love watching adverts every 30 seconds.,1
So many ads i didn't even know i was playing a game,1
Game is nothing more then a shity ad platform.,1
Bahen ka bhosada,1
So many ads wish I could give 0 stars. Uninstalled,1
Impossible to play with all the ads. Cool concept.,1
Far too many long pointless video ads. Its had 10 million downloads and it wouldnt surprise me if it had been deleted 10 million times.,1
Too many ads and after I've tried to play more I'm being scammed out of diamonds after defeating a boss it won't allow me to collect more than the 20 even though I'd be able to stop on the x5. Very poor the developers need to sort this mess out,1
Tooooooo many advertisements.. So annoying 🥱,1
Ads after every round.,1
Waaay too many ads,1
BEWARE! Ad trap and they even track your location and other information that should not be. You will get an Ad constantly. They even use your private data. Definitely shady people made this.,1
Really laggy and way to many ads,1
"There are FAR too many video ads that are FAR too long to make this game even remotely enjoyable. I don't mind ads, but this app has a ridiculous amount of them. Deleting!",1
I know that free to play games get teir money from ads but in this game it is just way to much. Every 20 seconds you play you get spammed with 30 sec ad videos to watch.,1
Just the worst... I want to give you zero stars..literally 5 seconds of game time and every button you press is followed by 30 second ad clips. Download this game if you enjoy the constant bombardment of ads,1
"This game is a waste of my time Every round is like 10 seconds long and there's none stop adds, I do not recommend downloading this add trap of a game 👎",1
To many ads,1
Like the game but the amount of adverts is ridiculous. After every game there's an ad! Will probably not play it because of that reason.,1
"The amount of ads they have is unbelievable. It isn't even a game, it's a waste of Ur life and the game is really easy because u know u need to have the biggest numbers to defeat the other team. It's also really boring cuz all u need to do is go to this corner thing Idk how to explain it but yea just don't download it because it's a waste of storage and time. P.S u earn the awards and double the money by watching ads ( endless ) and if u play like have an hour of that game u spend 20m with ad",1
This is so boring,1
"This game really is as easy as its ad makes it look, however this is also one of the most ad heavy games I've ever played. It takes 15 seconds to do a level and it can force you into (my worst) 4 minutes of unskippable ads. You can only claim rewards by watching unskibnskippable ads, rewards you've earned also require unskippable ads. Basically, this isn't a game, it's an unskippable ad farm. I've put half an hour into this game. 20 minutes of that time watching ads.",1
Very bad,1
Total waste of data and time my kids hate it and if they hate it I hate it so no win win,1
All adds after the 3rd board. Uninstalled at the 5th board,1
This game is the best,1
Adverts adverts adverts. Yeah you can switch to aeroplane mode but you lose some extras. Uninstall,1
I hate it,1
ads,1
Needs more game play vs forcing you to watch adds.,1
I GET PLUS +80 ON THE bonus AND I LOSE 120,1
"Nice game, shame about an advert after every single thing do. It's the kind of game I like playing. Sadly the deluge of ads takes the fun away. Reluctantly I've uninstalled the game",1
One level done one comercial each unistall fast...,1
Would be okay game if not ads every 10 sec,1
1 time game then 100 adds 😖😖😖,1
Too many ads. It literally plays an advertisement after every level.,1
Game has potential but I could tell this wasn't a game I wasn't going play for much longer. Stop making these games 90% ads and 10% game. I want to play the game that YOU made not watch 50+ ads in a span of 15 minutes...,1
Bad.,1
This would be a good game if it wasn't for the ads after every level!!! I understand the need for adverts but it's beyond ridiculous and the ads last 30 seconds each. I'm going to uninstall as it's frustrating!! 😕,1
Ads everywhere... It's more time spend on ads than gameplay. Go in fly mode when playing...,1
Ads are killing this game,1
"Way too easy, way too many ads. Play this offline so they don't show up. I sincerely hope they spent more on the ads that annoy us than they made from the ads we see in the game itself. Ads, ads everywhere.",1
සුපිරි ගෙම,1
too many ads!,1
"You literally spend twice as long in unakippable, long ads for other games as you do playing this one. This is a toxic practice from game developers. What is your goal? To get more people, some of which children, install as many games as possible and fall for your in-app purchases so you can maximise your profit? Shame on you.",1
Game is way to easy you literally can't lose. Gamefield like more of a bunch of ads and little game play,1
Worst game ever Waste of time and energy There are so many sponsored and the lord mobile most of the time the advertisement and i hate the most that lord mobile game,1
I don't like this app,1
Omg ! So baaaaad game i spend all my megas on ads ! Every 10 seconds you will watch ads All of you Remove this fkn app,1
"Mdrr quelle bande de rats, j'ai jamais vu un jeu avec autant de pubs juste injouable",1
"Far too many adds, uninstalled after 3 minutes.",1
Terrible and way too many ads,1
REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD,1
"Honestly its satisfying for like 5 minutes but the constant ads and the fact that the levels are all the same and do not increase in difficulty or have any chance as you progress is boring. Also kind of triggering, it doesn't even do the math correctly...",1
good game. I like it,1
Not 🚫🚫🚫🚫 boycott the app 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮,1
So many adds.i hate this,1
Ad after every level. Spent more time watching ads than playing the game.,1
"Garbage. If I wanted to watch 50 ads in a 30 minute period, I'd turn on the TV.",1
Ads,1
Bad game Do not try,1
"This game has way too many ads. I get that there's going to be some ads on a free to play game, but this is ridiculous. Literally between every level and anytime you do anything outside of playing a level. The game itself is fun, but it's not worth sitting through all those ads.",1
"The ads, ads, more ads, oh a level, wait though, it's more ads. Why would anyone continue this app, it's a waste of time. Oh........ Ads.... Ads",1
Ads after almost every level.,1
To many ads its a scam,1
"Publicita everywhere, you shoul watch videos after every match, and earn anything... You play a 10 seconds match to watch a 15 sec video (or more)",1
😊😊,1
"The ads ruin the game! It takes 15 seconds to get through a level then forced to endure between 1 and 3 ads between levels, some lasting 30 secs each. Had to uninstall before it drove me insane",1
keeps closing,1
"ok,",1
Ads every level is beyond bearable.,1
Gives sooooo many ads it isn't worth the time. Ads are longer then the levels take to complete.,1
Way too many ads.,1
The ads are annoyinh,1
"Nice concept, may want to try reducing the amount of ads to keep users longer. As is = uninstalled",1
"Too lag for samsung j5, thx",1
Way too many ads. Cable TV isn't even this bad. After every level!,1
too many ads.. every move with ads,1
"At what point is an app considered adware? You're literally better off clicking the ""watch an ad for free x"" popups, because regardless of what you click, you're going to get an ad. Seriously, chill out.",1
This game has way too many ads too frequent. The vast majority of time is spent watching ads and clicking back into the game. Game itself is ok and simple to play. But it is definitely not worth the amount of ads.,1
This game is not fun at all. I would love to play other but not this. Its a cheater. When you go to the more number it self go to the wrong one. The the ads i hate them that is why i play it offline you cant even win this game. And the finale of it is very very long. Who the person get it. I already delete it. Not enjoyable game. Last thing! When you get your price you have to watch a add first before you get it! And the ad is very long! You cant even choose a color ad first! I waited but ugly😞,1
A 30 second ad after every 10 sec round. Would be a good toilet game if it didn't have all the ads.,1
"I know everything is about making money nowadays, but not this way. Why too much advertising. That's just ridiculous",1
Ad showing machine,1
Waaaaaay too many adds. 1 for every stage and then more! I lasted about 5 minutes before uninstalling,1
"Played 3 levels each followed by an ad..... zzzzzzz, uninstalled",1
This game is chu**ya,1
A now idea 💡 what game,1
A 30 second add after every level. It's a joke. It's also a shame because the game itself is fun.,1
15 seconds gameplay 30 seconds forced adds not waisting time let alone money,1
Too many ads. Uninsralled.,1
Way too many ads the game the course is way too short there is a ad at the beginning and at the end,1
More ads than game,1
Way way way too many ads. Uninstalled,1
First of all there are ads everywhere and whenever i go above 200 in number my game lags.,1
Too many ads,1
TOO MANY ADS!!!!!!!!!!,1
Unskippable long ad after every tiny level. Was curious and played it for about a minute before the ads got too much.,1
Choper herp,1
So many ads. Can't enjoy playing. Every level there are ads.,1
Interest ing game but way to many ads. Uninstalled,1
"Shouldn't have to watch an ad after every level, bad user experience",1
"Basically you're spending 10 second playing, 30 seconds watching ads. Poor.",1
Absolutely tedious. Non stop ads,1
Horrible ad spam,1
many ads,1
Way too many ads. More time watching ads than playing the game. Good game spoiled by ads. Deleted,1
"Greed, greed, greed! Ad before and after each level! Removing the app",1
King,1
Foolish game.,1
"This is an ad machine, not a game.",1
Played for 15 seconds and was hit with two 30 second ads. Uninstalled immediately.,1
"Of 20 min playing, 17 min are ads... i instant uninstalli it.",1
Theres too many adds. I deleted it immediately 👎,1
"I wouldn't dislike this game as much, if there weren't ads displayed after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. I couldn't play for more than 30 seconds without another ad. Uninstalled less than an hour after installation.",1
"It's a 8 second match followed by a 30 second add, back and forth.",1
Too many ads,1
Very boring game,1
Too many ads,1
Toooo much adds,1
Nothing but ads,1
Not a game. Just ads. Uninstalled!,1
The game is dull with very little to it. Each level was extremely short with a ridiculously long advert after it. Longer than the actual level. So really not worth the time. Super boring.,1
A simple concept for a game jam packed with ads.,1
Cute but ads at every level It's too annoying.,1
Too many ads!,1
Two tutorial levels then 30-second advert. Pointless.,1
"The game has too many adverts, and the game is not challenging.",1
30 sec + ad after 15 sec of gameplay....uninstall after 2mins,1
Its bad,1
Trash,1
Ads will kill you. You can play 10 seconds and have to watch 40 seconds ads!,1
game too easy and just makes you watch ads most of the time....boring!!,1
Ads!!,1
"How about not putting an advert in my face every 5 seconds you jerk creators, so greedy its not funny",1
Waste,1
Too many ads,1
"It's justs ads. Make a paid version and it might be worth playing, but the ads are just so intrusive. Also the vibration control in behind the camera hole on the Pixel 5. ADS!",1
After every level theres an ad..yeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr just uninstalled this nonsense,1
To many ads,1
"Interesting little math type game, quick thinking to make the most of your warriors, but wow those ads just weigh this game down. There's more ad time than game time, so no thanks.",1
"It's so so, adverts are annoying",1
The crate for the new skins are always in the last crate you open.,1
It is soo easy,1
Ad bombardment,1
Ad fest,1
Too many ads,1
Ad after every level.,1
How did this game get on top charts it's the worst game ever so many ads and it's so laggy I can't even play the game! 0/10,1
Too many ads,1
Just ads,1
Fun i luv it,1
Ad factory with no option to disable. Fewer ads or a $.99 disable ads option otherwise it'll remain incredibly annoying. Pass on this.,1
Hate this dumb stupid game,1
Manobilli,1
Ad frequency far far too high. Does not make me want to pay scummy developers.,1
It's bad,1
This is basically just an ad-viewer with a low effort game in-between,1
These mobile games are getting worse these aren't real games,1
"You have to break the ad generator to even play the game. Once you start paying you realize it is garbage. The game is set up so no matter what you average 120 guys at the end. No rewards at all, all levels seem the same. Waste of time especially for those of you that don't know how to mod apps",1
After every level (which at most are 20 seconds long) you get an ad. Every. Single. Time. This game is just a bunch of constant ads with hardly any gameplay.,1
These aggressive ads made me delete this game after 5 min if playing it,1
Pangit,1
"Horrible greedy developers throwing in ads after one turn, I know they need adverts for cash but that really is taking the Mickey. Game deleted",1
It sucks so much I didn't even rate it tye adds suck,1
Very good,1
"Runs extraordinarily slow, constant ads, untextured polygonal mess, and atrocious menu design. I would trust ISIS with running the US over trusting these guys to make a good game.",1
Another game just so they can make money from you by Showing Adverts. GAME PLAY IS ALSO RUBBISH. Is this the company Voodoo under another name.,1
Too many ads.,1
Far too many add,1
"Way too many ads. Also the ads require you to press 3 tiny buttons every time. One to skip the add, next to close the little fake demo version and another cross to close the ""download button"" screen. And if you missclick the tiny buttons you get sent to the play store. An add is played after each game, to get ""earned"" skins, ect.",1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS AP. THERE ARE 3 TIMES MORE ADS THAN THERE IS PLAYING TIME. This games kills your battery with ads.,1
Whose idea was to show 2 ads with a waiting timer after each stage!?,1
Ads galore. No thanks,1
Ads all it is is ads,1
Too many adds.,1
Boring easiest game ever,1
عسكري برونزي غيرها نفر سيم عروسه عيونك النور قاهر قرأة قران فله فروضه سريعة قلة رز بن قرعة الروعة فاعلم قلبه فرصه,1
"The lag is crazy and sends you an ad every level, would not recommend this game",1
Very boring And ads 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤,1
Game of adverts. Every 2 seconds. Highly encourage you to not download this turd,1
"Ads are longer than play time. Understand ads are needed, but they appear between EVERY game transition AND they are literally longer than it takes to play a level. Will be uninstalling.",1
You play 10 seconds and then watch the add for 60 seconds. Good luck,1
Ads completely ruin it,1
2 ads after each level. No.,1
"Ads after every single thing you do. And even worse, an ad came up and randomly installed an app against my will. I couldn't stop the download. Only Uninstall it after it finished. Do not download this onto your phone.",1
"Basically designed for ad revenue. Not skill based, no thinking.",1
Just an ad fest. Don't bother.,1
This game is ridiculously glitchy. And you spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game. I'm deleting after it's glitched several times in the first five levels...,1
Too much Adv... can't tolerate it. Uninstalling the game ...,1
"Awful, and add ever thirty seconds.",1
Ads everywhere,1
There is a 30 second ad after every single level. Each level takes about 10 seconds to complete. Complete BS.,1
Terrible literally ads after every single level.,1
Shot,1
Ads after every level,1
This game is just ads you have to see 100 ads every one second and this game is noob,1
The ads are not skippable. And its every after the game. I understand it is a way to gernerate income. But you can choose the ads area when the player wants additional coins. Placing it in every after the game loses the gameplay experience,1
shite,1
Must've done 2 levels then got hit with an ad that's a no from me any game that has ad's like that ain't worth the download,1
There's to many Adds doesn't let you enjoy the game,1
"This game is buggy as heck. I didn't ""play"" long enough to see any ads. Every time I moved my finger the game clipped and did the opposite of what I intended. Lame.",1
Worst game very much add issue,1
"So good! I thought it was a dinky game, but it's just a cover up for a free netflix clone! I can now watch ulimited ads for free!!",1
Too many ads,1
Literally an ad after each level. Just don't DL this game. It isn't a game. It is an ad service.,1
You play for 10 sec...... then they force you to see a 15 sec advertisement.... uninstall,1
Definition of mobile game trash. Avoid at all costs.,1
Tate game,1
"The levels are too short, plus there are just too many ads after finishing a level.",1
Not a bad game just so many ads!,1
It helps to be smart,1
Good game but far too meany adds for it to be enjoyable take all the fun out what's the point of playing for a minute or 2 and the 5 minutes of adds and then the same thing on repeat,1
Tooooooooo much ads,1
Ads ads and more ads. It's all ads and nothing rewards wise makes sense. You don't even get a settings menu to get help or buy ads free play. Just plain dumb and annoying.,1
"Ads are too much, can be a good game, but ads won't let me enjoy the game, which is a good one",1
Too many ads.. can't play for 1 min. Could've been a good game without or less ads,1
way too many ads like it's ridiculous,1
Very bad game,1
B C game ad &ad only ad bakbash,1
Too many long ads compared to play time. After every short match there is an add that last 20 seconds or longer.,1
Couldn't even get 1 level done without a long ad,1
It might have been a good game but I couldn't tell because I had to spend more time watching ads than playing the game.,1
What's the purpose of this game,1
Finish at the same time as you,1
That's too short it's for baby,1
More ads than game play,1
"Ads, ads, more ads, even MORE ads. Ads after each level, that's crazy. Maybe at least every 10 levels would be fine, but 30 SECOND ADS after every single level, is absurd. Well that's just FUN😡. The game also gets boring after a while, so pls fix. This is more like a forest of ads, instead of a game. Do not download.",1
Do simple math between watching ads,1
To much adds,1
Repetitive and full of ads,1
Way too many adds!,1
There is an ad every single level. I hate games that do that.,1
I can't even open the app. What a waste of time and storage. >:/ would rate 0 stars if i could.,1
Horroroso,1
Ad after every go,1
WHAT A WASTE O TIME !!! I think this is more like 90% ad watching app and 10% game!!! AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
It is a good game for everyone,1
You'll be watching ads the entire time,1
Literally an ad watching simulator with minimal gameplay...,1
Too many ads,1
Too many forced ads. Levels are short and you get an ad after each one. You also have to alternate upgrades or you have to watch an ad.,1
played on aero plane mode for zero ads and zero rewards. never felt so good flippin a bird to greedy devs. this game still sucks anyway. bad programming oozing out of every pixel. blerg. boing. the 'bonus' is rigged.,1
This game is stupid and filled with ads,1
Many stupid ads,1
Toooooo many forced ads. You spend more time watching ads than playing. Game would have been fun if it weren't for. Sooo. Many. Many. Many. Forced. Ads.,1
Dude it gets boring in 2 minutes and it has so many ads gosh what happened to mobile games.,1
The amount of lag I hate Download this app if u love trashy games it's boring as well in order to gather stuff u have to watch a ad and after every level whitch is about 10 secounds u have to watch another ad over all very bad 1 star,1
"The game is horrible, you spend 30 seconds watching ads for 10 seconds worth of play",1
"Didn't even last 5 minutes as I uninstalled immediately due to the amount of ads. Lol, make it easy on the player if you want better reviews.",1
Bad this game is rubbish,1
Worlfs worst game,1
"If you enjoy watching ads more than actually playing anything, this game is for you! 5 seconds of gameplay followed by 30 seconds of ads. The same level repeats.",1
Couldn't even open the app,1
Thish game is not sound,1
Too much ads.,1
Tooo many ads. Ads time is very larger than game time,1
"Deleted this game after a few minutes because of all the ads. If I wanted to constantly watch ads, I'd watch free tv",1
"To be honest, I dont like this game ang I hate it",1
A good game but way too many ads. Ad time was greater than the time I spent on the first few levels.,1
The usual Ad complaint,1
More advertising time than gameplay time.,1
Some many ads. Ads are longer then actual game play. So annoying. Played for 5 min with 10 min of ads. Deleted! Don't bother.,1
"Ads and a bad game, mechanics are just bad and the game play is the same",1
Uh honestly I dident even get ads (airplane mode) it's just bad,1
👎ok,1
Kind of boring,1
it crashes every time,1
More ads than actually playing thr game,1
Way to many ads for how short each round is,1
Boring..,1
"The game is way to easy, holds too many adds to watch, and the game is just awful. Don't waste your time playing this game it's to awful to deserve attention. And this bad game has 50 million+ downloads SMH",1
Every single level makes you watch an add before you continue,1
No sound!,1
If only u guys made in purchase of getting rid of ads i would buy it for 5 dollars or 2.99 idc bro as long as yall make some like dat we good in till then ima uninstall,1
"I watched more ads than i played game, do not waste your time by downloading it",1
Full of ads,1
Too many ads. Uninstall,1
Too many ads,1
An advert every level? Really?,1
"Too much broadcast, stupid",1
Ads ads more ads,1
"It's a trash, a real trash!!! 😡😡😡",1
I don't even want to write anything here. Just know I did not enjoy this expirience.,1
I only had this for about a minute and a half. Played the first level and omg the sensitivity was SUPER high. It also kicked me out the app multiple times. No thank you. I wish I could give this 0 stars.,1
So bad you mother floppers who made this s h old go to thred man below hhhhaaaahhhyy,1
This game is fun but the only thing I don't like is the ads. I really hate the interuprions.,1
"Uninstalled. An ad screen after EVERY level at the start of the game. Mad it super easy to not ""get into"" the game. I even installed one of the games they advertised for and had to wait for the add to finish. Is this is game or an ad delivery system. Don't install",1
Absolutely a joke of a game. Levels take ten seconds and they put an ad after each one that takes three times longer to skip. I could see after three or possibly even two having an ad but just greed,1
An ad after every level. I spent more time in ads then playing.,1
Too many ads ruining the game. Bye,1
TOO MANY ADS TOO OFTEN! It would be fun.. but an ad after every level. To the creator. I hope you're making loads of money on ad revenue. Unistalled.,1
This game is can't downloading,1
This company just copies games and then just fills 'em with ads. It's so sad and when you turn on your phone it runs and shreds your battery. I would not recommend getting this unless you rly are looking for things due to the ads. It's just ads after ads after ads.,1
The game itself is fine. I refuse to sit through 30 seconds of ads after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Uninstalled.,1
To slow to folow sided and the constant ads its annoyng!?! 😫,1
Too much ads,1
Ad ad ad ad ad ad,1
If you like watching ads with an easy 2 second game in between then this is your game.,1
Too many adds to make it playable.,1
👎👎👎,1
Too many ads,1
"Soooo much adds, don't install this or you will spend more time watching adds then playing game, shame, concept is good.",1
Bad Game,1
Excessive ads ruin the game.,1
I love the game but there is an add after every level. This sucks and I'm uninstalling the game.,1
Just an ad machine,1
Far too many advertising of games literally every time you touch the screen it goes to an advert so frustrating,1
"It gets boring super fast, and is annoying at times",1
This game is so full of adds you finish a level ADD unlock something ADD 1/10,1
So many ads it's unplayable.,1
Don't waste your time. Just another game designed to make you watch ads. Zero entertainment value.,1
Forces you to have internet on to watch ads.,1
"The game is full of ads and boring, don't waste your time..",1
Levels too easy and last 10 seconds with ad between each level that last 30 seconds. You do the maths!,1
Adverts are a joke,1
Too many ads. Uninstalled.,1
Too many ads,1
"This game is not actually a game ... Is an adds master ... You play like 10-15 secs and after that you are forced to watch 5mins of adds ... Multiply this with the number of games you want to play and see what a complete waste of time this ""game"" is ... 2 mins of playing is 60 mins of watched adss 😅😅😅🤬🤬🤬👎👎👎 UNINSTALL RIGHT NOW !!",1
Ads please remove,1
"A lot of ads, so annoying. :(",1
Ads. Ads. MORE ADS,1
Ads longer than the game! Each level lasts 15 seconds max and is followed by one or two adverts needing 30 seconds.,1
This game 🎮 is boring 😴 😒 😑,1
"This game is very easy, for people that want easy win and watch a lot of ads..",1
Awful game experience. Ads after every single level. Terrible game. And you can't play offline!,1
Unnecessary violence for a math game,1
Nothing but adds this game is trash I mean really can I not play a few levels before you hammer me out with 30second can't skip adds,1
I really hate this game Because when the players number increases It is strucking Plz solve this!,1
To many adds,1
To much ad,1
There are a lot of ads,1
Way too many ads.,1
"Realistically you've got about 8 seconds of ads between every few rounds. Maybe my app just glitched out but there was nothing more to conquer after the regions of the US and no way to build up more than one island. It doesn't get harder as you play - once you've won once, you've won every time.",1
Trash,1
Such a childish concept That even a one year old could manage. Easy enough to work however the levels last about 30 seconds and then you get an ad. Clearly the intention of this so called game is just to get people to download it to increase revenue for developers. This is nothing more than a cash vehicle And not a very good one,1
Too many adds,1
Ads make it unplayable.,1
Bad and boring,1
"Liked the game, but adverts ruined it. Uninstalled as couldn't handle it anymore",1
Ads after every round and to do anything-watch an ad. Ridiculous and unplayable.,1
More ad then game🙄🎮,1
ads ads ads ads...,1
At first it was good and I loved playing this but when you start going to higher levels it's going to lag i was trying to pass level 10 but it kept lagging me and kicking me out the game and it sometimes froze on me :/,1
"More ads then anything, you spend 3-4 times more watching ads then actually playing the game.",1
Way to many ads,1
Very bad and boring game in the world,1
"Nice game ruined with a ridiculous amount of ads! Play a level watch an ad, build something it's another ad, tap for a bonus yet another ad! Every tap involves watching a 30s ad! Will be uninstalling as I don't have the time or patience for it!",1
Uninstalled because the adverts are a pain in the backside after every level. Not for me sorry.,1
There's no game is only an ad app,1
Bakwas app thousands of ads in a day while playing also 10 ads will come,1
Adds every level,1
The worst game,1
To many ads deleted,1
Downloading error,1
There are lots and lots of ads and it gliges a lot so I advise you to not download this game and if you already have it then delete it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Reklam,1
Absolutely horrible,1
Cant remove ads. Its like they don't even want money?,1
What's with all the Ads? Why the actual f..k is there an advert after every level? The developers should be utterly ashamed of what they've produced and the constant adverts. Deleted!,1
"Nothing new ,",1
Worst game ever,1
"overall, not the worst game ive ever seen. theres an entire genre of games like this- with bad 3D graphics littered with ads- and this is definitely one of them. 100% just a game made for money. the gameplay is mediocre at best- and i dont quite understand why theres an ""island"" feature. definitely going to be deleting. not worth a download.",1
The game is fun but you can't enjoy it because there is too many adds.,1
The ads make it a horrible playing experience. They just have gone overboard with it.,1
Definitely 1 star. There's ads every time you complete the level. Ads appear every 10 seconds which is annoying. It's fun for 5 minutes then you delete it. There is barley things to do. Achievements would make the game better.,1
"Too many ads, no way to remove them, game lacks depth",1
Could be a really fun game but the amount of ads is ridiculous.. I tried despite the other reviews & I don't mind an ad or 2 but this is not worth downloading.,1
"Worst app ever, it's not a game app it is an ads app, worst, annoying app",1
This game is ugly it has to many ads after I do a level ads come at the bottom of the screen a ad and I press it by mistake your game is ugly🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😤😠💢 bye bye,1
"Terrible, too many ads",1
Way to many ads. Was wanting and was lead to believe this was a simple math game. Bunch of weird stuff going on... Diamonds building castles. No thanks.,1
"Unplayable, awful, cheap. Too many ads",1
To many ads. Ad after everything you do. It's horrible.,1
"Annoying and disappointing, I played for ages but I just got pointless you can get your numbers up and be on for a great bonus then this stupidly places obsticle just takes half the numbers and there is no way around it.",1
What the?,1
Mader chode game,1
So many ads!!! Don't waste your time... move on to anything else. 10 seconds of game then ads ads ads...,1
Too many ads,1
Land jasa,1
"Terrible terrible terrible! Bombarded with adverts. And i dont mean every 5 minutes or so! They are aggressively poppedup at every move, every section of the game! And it's not like, here's and advert, click x to get out. No! They make you watch videos. So you play 10 sec, you watch 10, 20 sec! Don't bother!",1
Trash,1
I love this games is very pan,1
"Oh my God, the ads. They're longer than the actual game. Uninstalled",1
Awful. Here's some ads,1

L game,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads. This game actually is kind of fun though I have to deal with 30 seconds of ads after every level. Whats the point?,1
Too many adds,1
Because full of Adds it sucks a Internet,1
"This game is incredible: how is it possible to pack some many ads in a simple game? Even if you skip an ad, another (or 2) will automatically start! Everyone should play it to see how far greedy developers can go",1
So many ads I cannot play the game,1
Too many ads,1
Laggy as hell. Also I saw reviews talking how sensitive it was and I was wondering what they meant. It turns out the slightest twitch of your finger will teleport the group to the other side.,1
"You will spend more time watching ads than playing the game. I enjoyed the game,but not worth a 30 second ad after ever 15 second game.",1
Describe my experience? Ads.,1
Ad.ad.ad.ad.ad.ad.ad.,1
"Completed the first game, 10 seconds then a 30 second ad, ffs with the ads, ad finished then another 10 second game then another 30 second ad, uninstalled.",1
It's just a game to serve ads for other games. Hot garbage.,1
99.999 % of the time are ads,1
waste game time waste tuu chii evaru kanu petard podusta,1
Froze right at the beginning. Won't go any further ☹️,1
Just a bunch of adds,1
Good game,1
Way too many ads to be enjoyable,1
Free bonuses for watching ads is fine... but forcing you to watch MORE ads every time you do anything makes it unplayable,1
Horrible game always crashing,1
Too many ads.,1
..... sad.,1
Extremely advert heavy with extremely inappropriate adverts. Some even advertising games featuring sexual assault,1
Bad,1
Too much ads,1
Too many ads,1
It is only adds,1
If you love ads you'll love this,1
Just giving 1 star because the app uses insulting ads that make you think you're a dumbass that can't do basic math to get you to play it. Not to mention you're forced to watch an ad like every 30 seconds...,1
Too many ads,1
Waste of time. Very easy game,1
Too many ads,1
Non stop ads,1
To many ads,1
Too many ads. I understand the need to make money but holy hell! Literally an ad after everything you do. Even when you unlock a new skin... its an ad to open the package... instant delete. Horrible.,1
A series of ads with a little game in between.,1
Inappropriate pics in ads. Goodbye,1
Uninstalled after level 3. The reviews are right. 15 seconds of play followed by a minute of adds. Waist of time! Junk..,1
Would be fun if an ad would not play EVERY TIME I pass a level. Could not really enjoy the game because of that. Uninstalled.,1
AMOGUS SUSSY IMPOTSER SKIN!!!,1
Dg,1
Note cup of soup,1
Build this game Just for advertising,1
Add after every single level 5/1 add to play ratio,1
Way too many ads... And they're excessively long!,1
"Way....way....way too many ads. You play one round then ad that you can't skip 30secs. Then a round, ad...30 secs. Win a round get the crates can't advance unless you open all the crates. Each crate 30 second add",1
Super,1
Saim,1
"For a game that is supposed to be based on quick action and split second timing, ths game lags like crazy",1
I don't mind having ads but an ad after every single level is a bit ridiculous considering each level barely takes 1 minute. Why is there no way to pay for no ads?,1
too much ads,1
Awful coz you will not be able to play the game coz of too much Ads and it's too much annoying so I am Uninstalling the App,1
I haven't got to download it because it won't even let me! This is actually stupid. And I've read the reviews on the ads and they are horrible! This game would be terrible.,1
"10seconds of play, followed by 30-40seconds of ads.",1
"Spiel eigentlich cool, aber nach jedem Level kommt Werbung. Das nimmt jeden Spielspaß.",1
Enjoyed the game but uninstall after five minutes as there's too many ads,1
Why so many damned adds? Don't mind the odd one but every level pops up some add for some stupid lame game some 2 year old has developed. Steer clear of this you are getting more adds than game play.,1
Unplayable. Ads are longer than a round,1
"Awful game, terrible.",1
Bilcul hi tati game hai😠😠,1
"Game is fun, but the levels are really quick and there is an ad after every one. Spend twice as much time watching ads as there is game play. Deleting",1
Absolutely terrible,1
So many ads!,1
"Ad after each round. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game! Too bad, the game is kinda fun. NOT WORTH THE TIME SPENT IN WATCHING ADS.",1
"There is an unskipabble ad after every level you play, often being 30 seconds long. Seems like it could have potential to be another VOODOO type game, but even VOODOO isn't this bad with ads. Don't install.",1
"WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME GAME BUT IT'S REALLY AN AD WATCHING APP! 5 SECOND LEVEL AND THEN 30 SECOND AD. ADS AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN AT ALL TIMES. TO GET A SKIN OR ANY BONUS ITEMS, AFTER WATCHING AN AD RIGHT BEFORE, YOU HAVE TO WATCH AN AD FOR THE BONUS OR SKIN OR ETC. IT IS SO SAD BECAUSE IT WAS FUN AND YOU HAD TO THINK MATHEMATICALLY BUT UNINSTALL IS MY NEXT ACTION. THANKFULLY I DON'T HAVE TO WATCH AN AD TO UNINSTALL! OH, AND ASKING ME TO RATE IT AFTER 2 LEVELS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S AN AD MACHINE!",1
Too many ads,1
"Very fun game, but ill give it a one to much ads like non stop... uninstalled :)).",1
"Oh wow. Another adfest: unbelievably boring, pointless game. It lasted 3 minutes before I uninstalled. Hope you made some money out of it, because I won't ever be using any of your 'games' again.",1
Too many ads,1
Excessive ads,1
Ads. That's all I have to say,1
Bad way to many ads its ridiculous!,1
"Intrusive ads. Ads are an unavoidable evil, however, if your ads mute or pause my other media, that's a deal breaker",1
literally do not install this game you get average 100 people when you finish it's not fun,1
Unplayable. There's an ad after every 5-second round.,1
Not all phones can process that many entities,1
"Levels are long for about 10 seconds, ads after each level take from 1-2 minutes. About 10% of your time in the game will be playing remaining 90% is watching ads.",1
"Way, way, WAY too many ads. Literally, after every level. Each level takes less than 1 min.",1
Not worth playing.,1
Too many ads,1
Forced ad's.,1
Too much advertising,1
Add after each stage to annoying,1
I was watching ads more than playing. Not worthin,1
"Played this game for about 20 mins most of that time was adverts. I have honestly never encountered any other game where adverts take up more time than the levels. Completing a level may take 12 seconds, then you have to watch a 30 second video, absolutely crazy. Another reviewer commented on turning off your internet connection to avoid adverts, I would rather not play a game than be forced to play it offline due to high volume of adverts.",1
Nice,1
Too many ads,1
Super fun game RUINED by CONSTANT ads after each level. A common problem for this gaming company. Pure greed.,1
Free super The good game,1
"Ad farming game. Literally an ad every 20 seconds....... don't really know what else I expected from a mobile game these days. Waste of time, don't download....",1
play thev game and you will becom gay and u will have no girlfreinss ever firevee,1
Very boring,1
Terrible ditch this game add every couple of seconds ads are longer than the danm levels,1
It would've been a good idea if it wasn't a cash grab.,1
TO MANY ADS!!!,1
Awful nothing but ads,1
Stupidest thing ever,1
Stupid game filled only with ads,1
Best game add where you spend way to much time on adds than on the actual game.,1
Full of adds,1
So many ads...every single level.. you spend just as much time on ads as the game. 90s Cable TV didn't even do that.,1
Ghatia game,1
ads,1
Far too many ads. More than 1 per stage. Skip this.,1
hands down most boring game ive ever played,1
Very very bad experience...nothing toplay...only adds...bloody hell...who developed this useless one....only for adds...go to hell...,1
So cool,1
Ads after every level,1
I hate this game is soooo laggy,1
Too many ads,1
Your watch more ads then you play.,1
Too greedy. Gameplay is a brief interlude between adverts,1
just bad,1
Ads,1
"The game itself is alright, but the constant ads is really greedy, and if you want a skin? Gotta watch an ad! Want to buy another upgrade? It's free (oh but with ads!). Like calm yourself. Also i saw this is a ripoff of a game called Mob Control, barely anything is different, star off for that. Not to mention the advertising of the game is really cringy, like a 2 uear ild is playing it. There is quite alot of room and yet it almost always went for the one that gave you less people.",1
Hello This game is so boring there is not much to do .I would give it a 5 star for the badness .,1
Many thanks for your repeated 30 seconds advertisement in Alien Shooter. This is a small gift to say Thank you.,1
Too many ads and a lot of the skins look the same. Not worth downloading.,1
The App itself is rather predictable but on the whole OK.. what isn't OK however is the 30 second ad for other games .. if I had a mallet in the house I think I'd rather knock myself on the head over watching an ad after every level played and this is the main reason that this app has to be deleted .. Adios Amigo,1
"Rubbish, too easy, short levels and more time spent watching ads",1
Lags too much when u get like more than 50 soldiers i cant even move it its awfull,1
"Ads in game, and for this game, are both extremely irritating.",1
Glitchy. Wont let me run into the number i want. Immediate uninstall,1
"0 stars if I could, 10 seconds of game, then 30 seconds of ads.",1
Very bad,1
Way too many ads!!,1
Too many ads. The ads take more time than the actual game.,1
This game is very choppy for elders,1
To many ads.. Not playable,1
Nothing but ads,1
"Very ad heavy, also I got to experience an ad for the game, within the game. It showed gameplay of this game, but it was named something completely different. I wouldn't recommend this game because there is something very sketchy, and also sad about the ads that they choose not to vet, or they personally run those ads to trick people into playing their other games. My advice, avoid this game.",1
Each level 10 seconds of playing followed by 40 second ad,1
if you have anger do not play this game,1
There seems to be some kind of game between your ads display app.,1
Too many adverts,1
"I cant really say that this is a game, its an ads game",1
Unplayable. So many ads its ridiculous,1
The amount of ads is insane.,1
"When I saw this game, I expected uninteresting, mediocre, scammy garbage. And that's exactly what I got, I spent at least 30 mins to get to lvl100 and felt nothing. There was skins, Mountains of ads and a rigged reward system that forces you to watch an ad. I'm pretty sure this game has been made before, 100 percent sure, actually, the appitamy of mediocrity, also how does this game have 3 stars? Exactly how I expected. Also faulty English!",1
To many ads not worth my time playing,1
To many ads,1
Lots of ads.,1
More ads than game play,1
"- too many intrusive ads - asks how you would rate and only forwards you too rating if you want to rate it high - for stupid people who can't do math in their head - so underwhelming, i made the effort to write a review",1
"game is good but it is giving too many ads too many ads , i am going to delete",1
I have installed to play the game not to see the advertisement. Too much of ads.,1
To many ads!! One after every level!,1
Nothing but simple game with ad farm. 20 second match followed by 30 second ad.,1
Too many ads.,1
"I watched more ads than i actually play. Each round last less than 10 seconds, meanwhile each ad last between 30 to 60 seconds and you have to watch an ad every round. Screw this app",1
"Stupidest time waster on the planet. If you love wasting your life by watching ads, by all means - download it.",1
"If this was a game called ""watch ads"" it would get 5 stars plus. The levels take half as long as the ads tops and the other ""war"" feature is completely pointless and literally shows you which paths to take knowing full well you'll have to watch an extra ad to beat the hammer levels. Teeeerrrribleee. Could have been so much fun if it weren't centered around forcing you to watch ads more than you actually play the game.",1
Kabhi bhi is game ko download mat karna apan khelte he phir mobile rakh dete he to phir se 1st level se aata he sudhariye is game ko kutta he tu kutta,1
"Doesn't work in Landscape mode, only portrait! :-(",1
बेहद घटिया ऐप levels छोटे छोटे और ऐड उससे भी बड़े बड़े और ज्यादा Worst game with smaller levels and bigger adds,1
No challenge whatsoever. They simply take personal information from you and make money off the ads. Don't bother with this one.,1
This is very bad game. I hate this game.,1
ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS,1
No sound to this game.,1
Bokko bokka,1
Too much advertisement.. it ruins the game,1
"Great concept. However, each level is only 30 seconds or so long. That wouldn't be an issue except that in between each level is an ad ranging from 15-30 seconds long. So basically half your game play becomes waiting to be able to close an ad, or trying to close an ad that has a 'x' so small it takes multiple tries and lots of frustration. Installed and uninstalled within 15 minutes because I was so annoyed with ads.",1
"Way too many ads, 2 ads after every 15 second game, very poor. Shame as this could of been an enjoyable game",1
Too many ads with no option for an ad free version,1
"Got boring real quick, and you can't get anything higher than a 5.2x most of the time. 😒",1
Graphics and control are s#!$,1
Too many adverts! Uninstalled it 5 minutes after downloading!,1
Ads ads ads ads...,1
BGMIl LITE,1
"An ad after every level. 15 seconds to do a level followed by a 15+ sec ad. Don't download, total garbage",1
8 out of 10 minutes that you play is just ad. This game makes you infuriated!,1
Full of ads.. don't waste your time.. please don't download,1
Too many adds. Not worth my time,1
Crashed my phone,1
"Boring! Levels are way too easy, too many adverts after each round. Not worth it.",1
"This game is comically easy, takes absolutely no skill, and there is an ad between every single level. Don't bother with this garbage",1
Very poorly designed game. Stops allowing room for improvement at a certain point. All your scores max out around 100 no matter how many guys you start with. Like a hamster wheel that goes no where,1
You watch more ads than you actually play. Literally!,1
Adfest,1
Way to many ads,1
Way too many ads takes away all the fun so it's not worth playing,1
Adverts are an absolute joke .....uninstalling,1
More ads than playing,1
"Absolut trash. 100000 ads, every minute ad...",1
Toooooooo many advertisements,1
"Adverts every 10 seconds, I deleted the game due to this as the were longer than game play!",1
"Not only are there an advert after each level, the advert takes longer than the level",1
"Normally there are some ads In between the games, but here there is a game in between the ads.",1
There are too many ads! Literally after each level (which only takes like one minute of less to do) there is an ad. Please don't play this game unless you don't have a life.,1
Not good game,1
"Nothing but commercials with an occasional 15 second break for interaction. Games are dying, Greed is growing",1
It's fun but there are too many ads. You can't even pay to get rid of them as far as I can tell. I just deleted it.,1
Great concept. Wayyyyyyyyyyy to many ads.,1
Feels like more ads than game,1
Omg ads. Ads ads ads. Win a level. Ad. Unlock some stupid skin. Ad. Open the game? Ad. Ad on bottom of screen during gameplay. How is this acceptable. Ad. Ad,1
It was very laggy for me and I tried to use the pen that came with the iPad I can't even use it,1
Way too many ads. Got to the end of the first stage: get this skin (by watching an ad) or lose it? Select lose it. Guess what? I get an ad anyway!!! Amusing enough I probably would have spent a few bucks on it but that doesn't seem to be an option.,1
There's an ad after every level,1
Fun game but adds pop up after every level is really annoying.,1
Bj,1
Only played for under 5 min. Maybe played 5 games or such. The games are short and there are ads after every game. This game shouldnt even be on the play store. It sucks.,1
Add every game ridiculous 🤣,1
"Its just pile of **** (i mean ads, oversized ads, where even you cant click to close, you have to close game and run it again) you play one round for 10-15 sec, and there are ad, unclosable AD. Uninstaleed after 3 levels. . . Poor devs",1
Very disappointed to this game you will never win Hindi man lang makaabot sa pinaka tuktuk ng laro ano ba yan ayusin nyo ang game na to walang kwenta di ko na try manalo ni ka isa man lang 🥴,1
Boring,1
Too any ads,1
Too many ads,1
Awful,1
"Too many ads, stupid game",1
This game was the worst game of all time you get an add every five seconds it feels like,1
Too many stupid ads! Uninstalled. Never playing again.,1
Game looks fun but too much ads.,1
Too many ads,1
"Ad after every level, sucks!!",1
"Seriously don't bother, really short levels & ADVERT after every one!",1
Good game that you can't enjoy because the ad time is much longer then the game play,1
There are too many ads so I will stop playing the game and waste of phone space.,1
"Game play 5 seconds, ads 20 seconds. Worst game ever.",1
"Game is fun. Unfortunately too many adds. You get 30 second's of game play, then 5 mins of adds",1
Way too many ads.,1
The ads are atrocious! Ads after EVERY level and are longer than the gameplay,1
The game isn't good enough to put up with an incredibly long ad after every level. Don't waste your time with this.,1
Ad then ads then ad some ads to ad.,1
More ads than gameplay. Just an ad generating app to enrich the developer. Game should be removed from the play store.,1
Boring af,1
"Too meny adds, uninstalled every level takes 3 secs BOOM ads..",1
"Cool game, very simple but unplayable if every 20.seconds is an ad. Game is more about closing ads than playing. Had to uninstall... Too bad... Would have been fund mindless game",1
BOYCOTT GOOGLE GAMES,1
"Nothing but Ads, do not waste your time",1
Wast of time,1
Laggy laggy. Good luck trying to play this game when the 3D element to refuses to you work when you try to move your people out of the way of obstacles,1
An ads after every level or for every build is excessive. Uninstalled after ten minutes.,1
This game will hang your phone and with every one game they will give you 2 ads this game is useless it's better to not play this game,1
Meh,1
"An ad after every run is sickening. The game itself is fine but its 80% ads. If they can reduce the ads to like 1 after every 10 runs then it'll probably be 4 stars. Honestly, I played 5 minutes and deleted",1
"Ads, ads and more ads. Bored after 15 minutes.",1
10 sec game 30 sec ad,1
Poor attempt at anything other than a cash grab/ad spam.,1
To many adds,1
"For one, there's an ad after every single level. Then there's the random glitch that makes your guys jump to one side even if you moved them the opposite direction. In all, a very poorly built game",1
Please remove stupid ads. You will lose players with that much advertisements. It's not always about the money.,1
I love it,1
WAAAAAAY TOO MANY ADS Uninstalled.,1
too many ads,1
😭😭,1
ADS! ADS! ADS!,1
A lot of ad,1
"3 rounds 3, 30 second adverts. Uninstalled.",1
"Quite boring, you can get around Ads by turning off data and wifi then reopening the game, but then the progress is VERY slow, but with wifi on you get ads wayyyy too often. Overall, not worth it at all",1
Cum,1
The ads after every level are unbearable,1
It wasnt a good experience.They put a advertisement after you finnish every lvl.,1
Noob,1
This game is ok at the highest. After every game you get an ad. It gets boring after 5 times.,1
"Ads , Ads , Ads! Lots of Ads!! Between each stage there's an ad I can't skip until this is over !!!",1
The aggressive advertising in games like this really let it down. It shows the Devs don't care about your enjoyment as a player.,1
Ridiculous amount of ads.,1
Too many ads,1
"Nope, just another ""game"" built to advertiseothers, unplayable because of high level of Ads, uninstalled",1
"Too many ads, freakin annoying",1
"Adverts, adverts, adverts",1
Needs to be called Counting Ads Masters,1
PUTANG INA DAMING ADS. 🥰 MAMATAY NA SANA DEVELOPER NITO!! 😘,1
Ads after every level is too many ads and ruins the flow of the game.,1
countMastersCro,1
The ammount of ads are insane. I just openes the app and before I could even play an ad started playing. Every level you complete there is an ad that lasts about 30 seconds to a minute. Dont bother downloading.,1
"Waaaaay too many (Buy Pepsi Max, it's the taste you love!) adverts. Too little game 😔",1
An ad after every level absolutely not,1
YA GAME NA BAHOUT ENTRASING HA,1
Pathetic ad scam keep away,1
It's a terrible mess,1
Too many ads it's not playable!!,1
love to you,1
"Way too many ads, another ad every 10 seconds or so.",1
"So, just to prove to myself that this game was as dumb as its advertisements, I downloaded it and played to level 20. In that time, I saw more advertisements than I played levels and found absolutely none of the levels to be challenging in the slightest. You're better off playing something that's actually worth playing that doesn't have intrusive ads, such as tiny tower or clash royale or any game that isn't this one.",1
It would be great if it would stop freezing just because I have my Wi-Fi on because half the Skins you have to get on here require Wi-Fi,1
Thank you for this game i will supoport you and like all your games thank you for this game😍😍nice,1
"Unplayable, lengthy ads both during and between every single level.",1
Time waste... Nothing but ads,1
"Honestly, the game play is good but there is sooooo many ads..... It really takes you out of it and sometimes it's the ONLY way to progress...",1
"Lags alot, crashes when people number is over 350 and you lose alot of them. Can't run if you delete the 15mb chache game is cheaply made to rack up money clearly, should go actually buy a good game like doom or Minecraft instead of playing this capitalist bootleg cheap garbage",1
full of ads,1
One star for deleting my review. Previously I said the game was boring and it is. It is good for one minute of play and that is all it is. No skill required at all. You can let it play itself if you want to. Does not matter one bit. Would be three stars but for some reason my review is deleted so there you go.,1
"5 secs of play....20 secs of ads. Also, there is no way of exiting!!!!!",1
"Rypical adware garbage, a level lasts maybe 10 seconds and then it plays an ad. The levels are boring and uninteresting repeats of eachother. I really wish Google would crackdown on review bots because there is no way any human played this game and left 5 stars.",1
Garbage.,1
Ads after every short level. It's just an advert with game breaks,1
Probably the most unfair of the slapped together ad dispensers ive ever played,1
"Just garbage. Ads last longer than a game, even when you skip yhe ads by clicking the ""X"" when it pops up - and ads show up after every game.",1
Bakwaas,1
"Too many adds. Played for a few mins, 5 adds. No thanks.",1
Game is good but ur ads r toooooooooooo much 😡😡😡😡,1
Way too many ads,1
"Poor game, will not allow you to get high score. Always obstacles unnecessarily in the way.",1
Game achhi h but 1 star,1
Too many ads,1
Adds after each level. Very annoying. Never again.,1
Ads after every single level. hard to find the x button.,1
Play for 6 seconds & get an add for 20.,1
Bat games,1
Good game potentially but my anxiety levels got the better of me with the amount of ad's,1
Oh. My. God. How many ads are you going to have?!?! The game is unplayable as there are ADS IN THE ADS. Like why? Ads and ads and more ads.,1
Total worthless only ads shame on you developer just jump and die,1
No game it's totally adds,1
Luyanda The white person,1
Worst game ever its always lagging .dont waste your time to installed it😡😡😤🤬🤬,1
May to many ads,1
Only for children,1
Full of ads. Watching ads even more than game time.,1
noob game,1
It have too much ads because I don't want to play,1
"If you can't stand the ads, start the game with Internet off. Here u go no ads. Thank me later. Applies for most games.",1
😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚💏💏💏💏💏💏,1
"Fun gameplay, simple but fun. But for 1 minute of gameplay you watch 10 minutes of ads which is horrendous",1
Ads after ads after ads 😓,1
"Concept is great, however experience dampened by length of adverts between games - you've been warned ⚠️",1
Game would be fun but way too many ads to enjoy the gameplay I'd give it zero Stars simply because of how many ads there are,1
Waaaay too many ads,1
Ewww,1
Way too many ads. Ad after each try,1
🤮,1
Not interested bad game,1
Fullscreen unskippable ads appear after every single level. Don't waste your time,1
Constant adds,1
Too much ads! I hated this fact,1
"Deleted this game because, very much ads and the when the count gets above 110 it gets hang. Never ever seen this level boring game. Please don't download this game at all. I wanted to give this game 0 stars but can't give it. Very boring game.",1
Actual gameplay: lasts one millisecond Ads: last forever,1
WaqasAlii 45670,1
Too many adds. Right after every damn level.,1
bad,1
30 sec add after every level,1
Ads upon ads.,1
Basically unplayable due to you being overflown with advertisements,1
terrible,1
"Totally Intrusive Ads After Every Single Level, Yawwwwn! 90% less Ads and I'll change rating to 5 stars",1
More ad,1
Bad and boring game,1
I haven't even been on the app I've been trying to download it for the last 2 hours just laying in my bed trying to get it and it says you must download a game called stick man run to download it so I've been searching the last half hour for the stick man run game and can't find this so I rate this app a 1 start review and its final! 😡😡😡😡,1
"I nearly jumped out of a window after the 100th crypto currency ad, 30 seconds of game play 1 minute of ads 🤮",1
Constant ads,1
"Poor game, ads every level also. Don't bother.",1
Too much ads+it's a bad game+it's racist+ratio+yb better,1
לא יכולתי לסבול לשחק בזה יותר מחמש דק המשחק עצמו רץ יותר לאט מסבתא שלי אחרי שהיא אוכלת יומנגס ויש פרסומת כל שלב קיבל כוכב אחד כי כוסאמא של המשחק הזה,1
"Round takes about 10 seconds, yet adverts take 30 seconds. Uninstalled. Fun game tho",1
Rubbish,1
Could be fun but an ad after every single level regardless of if you win or lose is ridiculous! Every thing you do requires you to sit through an ad!,1
"I get ads are needed for income but no option to pay to remove them and an ad after every level is just too much, considering a level take about 30 seconds",1
Didn't play it for long,1
It was a really trashy game with too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
"I liked the concept of the game, but it is suck bs. I got 300 troops and the jump over the spikes only carried half that over, and I lost the rest. Do not get this game. It is terrible.",1
Way too many ads,1
The game is horrible I lag so bad I lose my people before I even see where I am moving,1
Too many ADS,1
Far to many adds to make this a game.,1
"Ad after every very short level, no thanks!",1
"Oh you just played 5 seconds ? Here have 30 sec of ads. Played another 3 seconds, have another 30 seconds of ads. -> Uninstalled",1
"Ads, ads and more ads. Spend more time on ads them game play.",1
Ads are shocking!,1
Crazy amount of ads,1
"Game is okay, but you will spend more time watching ads then playing it :(",1
ads ads only ads this is ridiculous,1
"Clearly an ad grab. Also, the game locked up my OnePlus 9 Pro twice",1
Gg 😂😂😂,1
Too many ads. Whoever makes the ads for this game should be shot.,1
And ad after every round. Want to play the game? Too bad watch an ad.,1
Too many adds,1
"Too many ads! I even turn my wifi off and there is still ads! I don't use data either so I don't really get why there are so many! If you want your game to hit rock bottom then keep on making ads, your fault, not us.",1
Play the add correctly and make this an actual good game and stop playing 20 ads every 10 seconds,1
Holy ads! Not worth the play time.,1
An ad after every level. I understand a game needing adds if the game is free. But to that degree is a money gouge. Horrible practice for a game that actually has potential,1
"User manual : 1 - download app 2 - disable internet to prevent ads 3 - play the game for couple of minutes 4 - ""like others, this game has no interest because all level are the sames. 5 - delete the game 6 - enable internet again Enjoy 🙂🙂🙂",1
Fun for a moment but after that it sucks also every minute game play you get an ad over and over and over and over.,1
"This game is laden with ads that you can't skip, and various shady practices, including the abundance of content locked behind ads. This game is essentially an ad, with the occasional bit of incoherent gameplay.",1
Forces you to watch ads after every level. A level only takes a few seconds to complete. Really it's just a conduit to feed you ads.,1
Dont waste your time. Too many ads.,1
Another stupid game is fun at the begining but the adds kill in a couple would be ok but they loke wasting your time i understand advertising is necessary but dont over do it if you dont want poor reviews also the game froze and stopped working its just garbage,1
Bad not funny,1
Way too many ads. Absolutely ridiculous! Fun concept but I refuse to watch an ad after every game. Deleted! Good luck finding people to play this lol,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads and you can't even skip it. 20sec ad after each round.,1
Way too many ads,1
"10 seconds of gamete, 45 seconds of ads. Dont waste your time",1
Too many ads. Couldn't even figure out how to purchase game.,1
First game is entertaining. Then you realize its a cash grab from ads. No real challenge or fun comes of it,1
Too much ads 🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
Good game for people that like to watch 3 minute ads after every 10 second level.,1
Too many ads!!!! You can't even get the rewards for watching an ad after a level is complete. The ad ends then it goes back to the same screen without giving the extra gems your supposed to have earned from watching the ad. I get its s free game but come on. Really? The ads are so much I don't even want to play.,1
To many adds,1
Bad,1
More like an ad streaming app lol,1
"Fun, but that's way too many ads",1
Its doodoo butter forreal,1
More ads than gameplay,1
ADDS AFTER ADDS,1
"Wow; this is just an ad machine broken up by 10 seconds of actual game play. You can play in offline mode to avoid the ads, but the rewards take a hit.",1
Way too many ads,1
Filled with ads. Waste of time.,1
Too many ads.,1
"Too many ads, give me paid version",1
"Nice little game, but absolutely unplayable with the amount of ads and no option to purchase an add free. Had to give up after 2 minutes. There is an advert after every level. About 80% of your screen time is adverts. Shame the developers are so greedy really.",1
Ads are unbearable,1
Too many effing ads,1
"a lot of AD, game 10 % AD 90%",1
"It really is just an ad pusher. You play for 10 seconds, then watch a 15 or 30 second ad that is usually a ripoff of Finding Nemo, but all the characters are just eating each other. It is very strange. The game has potential as a time waster, but it really disengages you with the ads. Try stapling or sewing your fingers together instead... it is more entertaining and you won't see any weird ads in the process.",1
"Awful, so many ads. 5 second round followed by 10 second ad.",1
Advertising sink! Company only wants to force ads down your throat otherwise decent game.,1
"Ads every level, sometimes 2 or 3 at a time that crash the game and won't let you play. Better off picking your nose.",1
"This is not a game it is literally a commercial app, install this if you want to watch ads.",1
It is good game,1
spending more time watching ads,1
Mukhang empakto,1
"Don't install this app, u will waste ur time by watching too many adds. It's a real trash.",1
Horrible game you can't even play for because the so much ads is so boring as well because no matter how much how could you play this always so many obstacles and you don't even get to play properly,1
Way to many ads and ads last longer than the stages.,1
Unplayable with the amount of ads. 15-20 seconds of game play per 5 seconds of ads.,1
Waaaaay too laggy,1
Very bad game ... too much lag is there,1
So many ads,1
Lot of ads,1
Ads everywhere,1
Sucks,1
Shite game with loads a ads and knacks gameplay tbh I don't think you should buy as ots canny knacks,1
Too manu ads,1
"Bad and repetitive, atleast put time into character creation instead of adding the first 3d figure you see in paint",1
"2nd time ive not gotten the reward for the ad, not the most stable system there is.",1
Way too many ads.,1
5 seconds to beat level followed by 15sec ad. What a joke!,1
It is not a game.. it is only a commercial app which make advertising for other applications. Boring!,1
The game is pretty good and would give more stars but way too many ads. I mean seriously the levels only last a few seconds and there is an ad after every single one .,1
Toooooo many ads !!!!,1
"10 seconds to complete a level followed by 30 seconds is ads..... 25% game, 75% watching ads. don't waste your time.",1
Rubbish. Constant ads,1
But can it bring back my wife,1
Too much ads,1
"More time on ad's than game, rubbish, don't waist your time",1
I understand that free games have ads but Jesus Christ! I uninstalled after two rounds of ads.,1
Way too many ads. Would be fun if you didn't have to see at least one ad every time you made a play.,1
Ads every page. Nope,1
Soooooooo many ads! Touch screen? Ad...,1
Worst game ever and every level there is a unskipable ad and you have to reload the game,1
Not nice,1
Fun game but the sheer amount of ads between literally every clicks make the game NOT worth it..,1
Rachappa batlura,1
The game is fine. That bloody Blackout Bingo ad has no mute button and intrusive. For that reason alone I'm uninstalling. Bloody annoying,1
It gicixs,1
Too many ads,1
Ad pusher,1
Too many ads. You can tell game was only made for ad revenue.,1
For every 8 s of game are 30 s of ads...uninstalled immediately,1
Trash app clear for farming ad revenue. I just played four rounds that all lasted under 10 seconds and immediately followed by 20 seconds of ads.,1
Too many ads. Too repetitive,1
Not a fan all these games are all the same unfortunately,1
Rehnay doo..bhai..😌,1
Please stop treating people like are thick on your tiktok ads.,1
Way to many ads,1
"Horribly boring and simple. Pretty much just move to the bigger number. ""Oh but sometimes one side is multiply and one is add!"" It generally doesn't matter, you'll still get to the end",1
"Absolutely terrible, good graphics and concept, but when I tried to play 1) Ads just kept popping up 2) App crashes suddenly 3) The touch doesn't work halfway through and I can't play the game (mainly cuz the ads cover half the screen ig) Terrible game",1
"Completely pointless, way too many ads. Not enjoyable due to the ads, very easy start and no really increase. Ads for the game making better than it is. Also there ads running on the bottom of the screen",1
Comfortably one of the worst games I've ever played. Ad after every level if you can even call it a level. I don't think you can even fail. Purely made for tiny boost of joy at the easy levels to give as revenue. Yes it's as poor a game as the ads on other games make it seem.,1
Too many ads.,1
😭😭😭😭😭😭😤😤😤😤😤😤,1
زبالا من كثرت الاعلنات,1
Way too much ads,1
Too many ads. It's ridiculous to have an ad every 30 seconds. The play time between ads is less time than the ad itself.,1
good,1
Terrible app. Too many ads. V v v irritating,1
I mean Ad after EVERY level?! Come on guys,1
Too much ads... to a point where every single thing you do have one.,1
Half time watching ads,1
Too many adds.,1
"Well if the goal was to make an AD that sometimes lets you play something, yall did a great job!",1
"Too many ads, impossible to play, I used to turn off wifi and data not to watch but then it becomes boring, every level is the same thing, I got 218 and nothing changed",1
Played for an hour. Got tired of the ads.,1
Why can't my game download,1
A waste of time ads way to much,1
Too many ads. Pathetic,1
So many ads!!!,1
Wow,1
Wow,1
"Really? Whats the point in this? No instrutions, just play for 5 sevonds and watch 3 ads for other useless games tjat make you go to playstore.... Im waiting for a lawsuit for draining a persons battery out cause they need $$$$..... Cant get money if you lose the cumtomers.... I wouldnt be shocked to find ot this is some kind of virus..... Doesnt deserve any stars!",1
"Again, after all of the other reviews, only exists to force people to watch ads.",1
Literally a ad after every level,1
It's like 30 seconds of gameplay followed by 30 seconds of commercial unless of course you want to unlock bonuses or upgrades then it's 30 seconds of gameplay followed by a minute of commercials.,1
"I played this game for 10 seconds and encountered 2 ads, lmao",1
Full of ads,1
One of the worst app with lots of ad,1
Too many ads,1
Every level you forced to see ads not worth even 1 star,1
Way too many ads.,1
A. F. F,1
This game would be fun but every round there is an ad. And every ad forces you to X out of it 3 times. Taking a total of atleast 15 seconds. So 50% of your play time is watching ads. Horrible platform to run a game on. Don't download this.,1
Too much ads,1
Too glitchy worst game ever,1
Gud,1
Too many ads also you cant pass the obsticals without people dying if you have a large number of people,1
"Ads on ads on ads. Don't bother, not with your time.",1
Not good,1
"Level is short, ads are long. Don't install.",1
Game is fun. WAY TOO MANY ADS.,1
There's more ads than a normal cable tv,1
"Hella lag. Like it encourages you to get large numbers of people JUST to melt your phone, then not to mention, the ads are ENDLESS.",1
Longer ad time then game time.,1
Dog 💩,1
Utterly useless. Not challenging.its scam in name of a game with only purpose is to show ads.,1
Virus game.. to many ads.. too many lagging!! Fuxk worst game,1
Very bad,1
"Very bad game lots of ads.... Hanging many of time in between running... Totally moode off.. Please don't try this.. Totally frustrated with ads with 10s,25s,30s, Evey time ..",1
"Terrible, spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game, just a money grab",1
To much ads,1
Boring game with lots of adds,1
5 seconds of gameplay followed by 2 minutes of ad every single level. If you enjoy watching ads then you'll enjoy this game.,1
Boo! l take 1star this game is stupid!,1
Terrible,1
"I didnt want your damn game! I clicked the freaking X, and it installed! That's just wrong!",1
Its so trash bro this is so boring bro,1
If you give me an ad after 10s its a bad game,1
This game is 90% ads and about 10% game.,1
The worst game ever how is it first OMG,1
Tons of ads,1
Holy ads Batman! Ads after every single level,1
"Les niveaux durent mois de 30sec et il y à une pub qui bloque l'appli à chaque fin de niveau. C'est assez honteux, on passe son temps à regarder des pubs, pas jouer.",1
Levels are over within seconds and after each level there is an ad. Instantly uninstalled.,1
Laggy,1
"When ad's last longer than game play, it's a problem",1
Too many ads!,1
"The game is repetitive and after a while gets annoying, the ads, the ads are everywhere and nonstop, so not install",1
Phuck your ads,1
A ad took me here so 1 star,1
Ripoff of crowd city,1
That's 😞💩💩💩💩👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,1
The game is gliching to much,1
Sooooo many ads each time you finish a level. I wouldn't bother,1
The game is entertaining but the many ads between each stage made the game boring so the game was uninstalled,1

"Boring...and ads after EVERY single moment, even when u press the option not to upgrade and view the video. I played for maybe 5 mins and deleted the app.",1
So many ads inside the game have disturbed the playing experience. It gets irritating,1
Trash of advertising. Vested time,1
Lost interest fast,1
Very scummy ads. The ad is on the bottom of the screen and when I swipe up to access my home and back button IT DOWNLOADS THE APP IT'S ADVERTISING!!,1
"I download games, but why i felt that i download ads app. Tooo many ads, cant play the game due to ads.",1
"Way too many ads... Want to get this skin? Watch an ad... Lose the skin? OK, here's an ad!",1
"Game play is good, full commercials with no skip after every level is not. Uninstalled because of too many commercials.",1
Horrible. annoying. Waste of time. Ads after every single level. Simply stupid and annoying.,1

Adds,1
Too many ads,1
Ad,1

Bad game👎,1
Just another time passing game where you spend most of your time watching ads. Get idle miner. Time passing and offer compensation for your game. You are never forced to watch ads.,1
Too Much Ad ... Irritative... Ads,1

"Typical ad machine game, any fun gameplay is ruined by levels shorter than the ads crammed in between levels.",1
"Ads, ads, ads, and more ads 🤮",1
Too many ads,1
Ads,1
"Fair enough, I expected lots of ads. But as soon as I started playing, an ad popped up, I waited for it to disappear, to find out there was no cross to get it off? I shut down the game, opened it again, then the same thing happened. Another advertisement that I couldn't cross off. Really is a shame because it seems a fun game.",1
Hens wow beautiful bathtub Brynn full,1
Jyada majedar Khel Nahin Hai,1
This game has to have access to your location to run right.... why? Ads after every run i spent more time watching ads then playing i like the game just dont like watching more ads then i do playing and dont like it requires location to run right. Get rid of ads and location permission ill redownload,1
Too many ads,1
"Fun game, but the forced ads ruin it.",1
Too many adverts,1
to many ads,1
loda game,1
"Do want to watch an ad every level that takes longer than to play the game??? If yes, this is for you. An Ad after Every level is ludicrous and created by greedy developers, quickly deleted.",1
The ads every 30 seconds are exhausting. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.,1
Ad simulator,1
"there s an add after every lvl, it s SUPER ANNOYING",1
Bad at mth I am,1
Very lagy do not recommend inter- net is bad witch makes it hard to dodge the obstacles. At the same time the ads on a normal game Are about 20% but with this game 70% of it is ads. Its programed so no one can get to the top. It made my phone realy hot. Do not recommend.,1
4 30 second ads with in the first 3 minutes. Watched more ads than I played.,1
Spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Complete trash.,1
Ads pop up in the middle of the game.,1
Way too many ads,1
Very Bad Game it lags and stop workin when you get up to 600+ stickmens (i got it on x5),1
I thought I was going to play a game. Not watch ads all day,1
Ads every end of gameplay,1
Even a 4gb Ram phone is unable to run this small game,1
Adds adds adds adds adds adds This game was made to earn the creator money and that's about it.,1
Tooo many distracting ads for a simple game,1
Adds after every level,1
Every match lasts less time than the ad they'll throw at you immediately after. Id be surprised if anyone has ever kept it installed longer than 10 minutes,1
I don't mind the ridiculous number of ads if they loaded and allow the games functionality to work. Total waste of time.,1
Ads ads ADS don't buy the no ads cause it's a scam I didn't even get my money back if there where no ads it's STILL A 1 STAR cause it's to easy this is for 1 year olds alright and that's my end of the story even if u got 10 dudes you can easily beat the game,1
You will never get more than 6.0 stairs or 200 army.. bye..,1
HATE THIS GAME,1
I deleted this..only next game advertisement 😤waste of time 🥴🥴,1
"Fun game, but an ad after every level is ridiculous. I played about 6 levels before I uninstalled.",1
So many ads omg,1
Fun game but ads are very long,1
This was a fun game to start but the higher up in levels you get the more ads there are. I probably spend more time watching ads then I do playing. I'll be uninstalling.,1
Play for literally 9 second.. An ad u will have an ad every 9 second,1
Adverts are longer than the actual playing time. Don't bother you'll just end up uninstalling it anyway.,1
Too many adds .... it actually kills the mood.. deleting it,1
This game is nothing but never ending ads,1
Add cash grab that's collecting far too much data - avoid,1
Ads ads ads,1
Very short and easy... The ads are longer than the gameplay..,1
Way too many ads,1
An ad every 15 seconds,1
They force an ad down your throat after Every Single Level! Not worth it.,1
Too many Ads,1
It's better to play with out internet other wise you will fed up with this,1
Too many adds,1
"Too many ads, unplayable",1
No Just no,1
Way to many ads to even start to enjoy the game. Download and uninstalled all in 10 mins and 9 of those mins were spent on ads.,1
Why do you need a add every 10 secconds,1
The game is cool! But there are too many interruptions/ads. I am uninstalling because the ads take the fun away.,1
"Like all advertised games, unplayable. Ads after every round/level, (every 20-30 seconds). They also have you save up points from levels towards a reward, but they make you watch ads if you actually want to collect that reward. Very disappointing",1
You guys HAVE to balance down the ads. This game is unplayable because of the ads. Literally freezing up my Note 20. I had to restart my phone because it froze due to the ads,1
Is it a game or just to watch the ads,1
"Way to many adds, can't even finish a level which then causes you to lose.",1
Wow... Ads... And more ads.,1
It's Not a game it's just a means to advertise other content. It's honestly a shame. It was fun while it lasted though,1
Its bed game for me,1
Interesting game but the constant barrage of adverts ruins it completely.,1
"This game is absolutely amazingly garbage. Every single level I get past there is an ad. STOP IT WITH THE ADS! it's boring as well. It is WAY to easy. You do the same exact thing every single level. Mix it up a bit. All I want to say is, this game is terrible, there is no meaning, and don't download. This is the worst game I have ever played in my whole life. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎👎👎🤦🤦🤦",1
"Too bad, the ads are completely annoying...",1
"Finish a level, have to restart the game because the ad is far bigger than the screen so it can't be closed.",1
Too many adds. Uninstalled,1
Adds kill this game had to delete. Don't get this!,1
"Great fun for about 5 minutes! Although 3 of them will be adverts. Honestly, once your island is fully built which takes no time at all, there's no point playing this game! Kept me amused for a few minutes but uninstalled now, waste of time.",1
Много рекламы,1
The app that has a game included with ads that are Endless all it is Level-ad-level-ad-level-ad Ads ads ads and more ads NO,1
This game is very goda game so this game me sudhar lavo,1
"Whoa, ads like crazy",1
Have a lot of ads,1
"Too much ads, doing to uninstall,",1
Succ,1
Levels are incredibly simple and it's at least 50% ads,1
Way too many ads had to delete it.,1
Ad ad ad ad easy easy boring,1
"Ads after every level. Bear in mind, each level takes 15 seconds to complete. Completely unusable. 1/10 do not recommend.",1
Reclame peste reclame o porcărie de joc.,1
It is nice,1
This game is shockingly bad.,1
Way too many adds 2 per level is ridiculous,1
"You know it isnt a terrible game but it is the biggest ad trap ever. You get a long ad every level. Additionally, it coaxes you into even more ads by switching the ""next level"" button to a play ad button every so often. Then it gives you rewards and you can claim additional rewards by playing two more ads but of course, this is not optional you have to play the ads. It is not addictive enough for me to accept this scam the creators are greedy and don't care about the game in the least. Deleting.",1
5 stars for dullness 👍🏻,1
Fun but unplayable. There is an ad after EVERY level which are longer than the level itself. So really this game should be called Ad Masters as all you are doing is watching ads. Insta-uninstall,1
Way to glitchy,1
Boring,1
Way tooooooooo many ads.,1
This game is AWFUL. the levels are ridiculously short and there are so many ads! Not to mention how many lag spikes you get. Not worth the time,1
Volume of ads is ridiculous! Stopped playing for this reason only after 5 minutes!,1
To. Many. Ads. Jesus. Christ!!!!!,1
Ads galore,1
"I downloaded this game before.... Now I remember why I deleted it. Cool little game, clever premise and cute graphics but advertisement after EVERY SCENE?! 30 seconds gameplay... 60+ seconds ads...REPEAT. NO THANK YOU",1
Another annoying filled with reasons to click other apps. Every level you get a add you click the X and it still sends you to the app you try to go back it sends you to another ad YOU CANT ACTUALLY PLAY THIS GAME DONT BOTHER!!!,1
Trash ads and players,1
This is west game dont download the game,1
Too many ads. Spent more time watching ads then playing.,1
"Shoves ads down your throat. This game is a generally well thought out game, looks decent, however a level lasts one minute-ish and has a 20 - 30 second ad. This means that 1/3 of the game is adverts. It is a good game. Just not worth the ads. Just note i played the game for three minutes and uninstalled it after. Thats how annoying the ads are. 1 star. No wonder the average review is 3.2 stars. Dont waste your space and time here. Its terrible.",1
I hate how every 30 seconds thererase a add,1
An ad after every single game round? No thanks. Awful game experience.,1
Ad farm play 15 second level forced to watch 30 second ad,1
This game sucks! Every single round there is an ad and let's also mention that it's VERY glitchy so much so that if you go more than 190 players it glitches ALOT. Also at some point you don't even do anything with the gems. And finally the skins are the most lazy and dumb skins ever. This games is entertaining for like 5 minutes and then it gets boring. Would not recommend downloading.,1
Add trap,1
"Really fun and simple play. But there are SO MANY ads. After everything you do. Plus you run out of things to use the diamonds for so it becomes pointless. Uninstalling, because the ads are just annoying!!",1
You can't beat the first level!!,1
Too many ads,1
Sucks like the 147 game I've installed today which is called archero,1
Have had the game 5 minutes. Half of that time was spent watching ads. Uninstalled.,1
This game has to many ads made it unfun to play.. every level got ads..,1
"May as well be adware stalking information for ads and gathering information to ""enforce the law"".",1
Can't play for a minute without at least 1 advert popping up,1
I have data and it restarted the download WHY DID IT DO THAT,1
15 sec of game followed by 2 min of adds. Uninstall!!!!!,1
"It is fun, but levels are so short and you have to watch a full add after each level. You end up spending more time watching adds than you do playing the game. ☹️",1
Silly game and gar far far too many ads,1
Way toany ads and movements are ignored,1
"10% gaming, 90% ADDS",1
Boring Laggy mess. But what did you expect from this disgusting studio,1
Ad fest,1
Ads every 20 seconds! Trash. Couldn't be worse! Greedy ....,1
Nothing but commercials.,1
Ads every level after everything you do.,1
Too many adds,1
The game is the worst game ever it always glitches and the ads are the worst.,1
It takes less than 30 seconds to finish a level. And after EVERY level you are required to watch an ad for 30 seconds. I feel like I am playing a watch-ads game.,1
The game itself is fairly entertaining but the amount of ads is in unacceptable. Don't waste your time.,1
There is nothing only ad ad and ads... Rubbish app,1
Levels too short and too many ads,1
Way too many ads.,1
Very jittery controls. Unpolished and underperforming,1
Advertisement,1
The best way to play the game is to activate airplane mode (trash),1
"Ads after every round, and the rounds are only 10 seconds long so that's a lot of ads. Uninstalled.",1
Game literally froze and crashed after playing three levels and watching a billion ads. The app couldn't do simple math to realize that 19 can easily subtract from 185 so I got punished for it. Not worth my time...,1
"ads, ads and ads every time",1
Ads the game!,1
Jeezus... An ad after every 10 second level? Brutal... Not worth it at all.,1
Ad's every ten seconds!,1
This game sucks 🤢 it is not epic it's not fun 😭 I don't know what to really giveit a star but I have to or they won't let me post this review 😠 it's not even responding 🤬🤬🤬 for this game blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I hate it hated hated hated 🤬😠🤬😠🤬😠😠😠😠🤬😠🤬🤬 trust me do not download this stupid game 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 my sister downloaded and I thought it's funny but it's not 🤢🤬😠🤢🤬😠 you make me wanna barf really 🤢🤢🤢 if I could I would give it 0 stars,1
Too many ads.,1
"Not a great game. Most of the time you are just watching ads and 80 percent of the time, you aren't even playing the game, it would be better if there was not as many ads",1
It freezes,1
Forcing the players to watch a 30sec comercial after each stage is ridiculous.,1
Too many ad even though actual game is good,1
Ads are just ridiculous,1
"You would have to be mentally impaired for this game to pose any kind of challenge. You might think, for the first few minutes of playing, that it will get harder as you progress. It doesn't. You literally just need to understand the difference between multiplication and addition. That's the whole game.",1
Ad scam spam,1
Almost unplayable. 30 second advert after every level. Adverts last longer than the levels.,1
Ads ads ads ads ads and more ads,1
There are way too many ads. I couldn't enjoy it at all because of that.,1
Too many ads its unplayable,1
"As the advertorial-playing-ratio is about 80:20 it's not much fun. Im aware such games always have adds, but that is simply too much. When the adds take up more time than the actual game I could just go to YouTube and watch the same adds over and over again. Did I already mention the excessive amount of adds in this game? To match the ratio, my review is also more about the adds than about the game which would be an ok time killer if it wasn't for such an overload of adds. Conclusion: ADDS!!!",1
"Ad bait. Level 1 takes 5 seconds to complete then 10 second ad, same level 2 then uninstalled at 3. I don't mind ads and I understand they're needed to keep games free but that's a joke",1
"More time watching ads than the level you're playing. Seems kinda interesting, but can't get into game with long ads after every level.",1
"Just installed to give a bad review, didn't even opened the app",1
Download,1
More ads each level I don't like please don't download this game,1
So many ads...,1
too many ads,1
Good game but the ridiculous amount of ads after each match is so freaking aggravating made me delete the game,1
Tooooo much adddddddsss 😐,1
Not good,1
I love it,1
Way to Ez please make it harder I bet my baby sister could beat this with a little bit of coaching!,1
"Play one round, watch an ad, play one round watch an ad. 5 minutes of this and I've uninstalled the game. Shove your ad's where they fit.",1
"This game is completely garbage. Every level you complete , theirs a damn advertising. The advertising is longer then the level you play . Waste of time . This game shouldn't be in the Play Store Ever!!.",1
"Worst app ever seen , i played for 5 minutes and ads arrived 10 times. Every single play they pop up their ads .",1
"Bloody hell, how Google play allows this many ads! It was against the rules, what happened to the rules! Reported.",1
Game is very fun but wayyy too many ads. Not worth the hassle and time. Uninstalling.,1
I don't like this game it's wasting dara,1
Pokh duuuuu,1

Losing time watching adds more than playing,1
Dumb af,1
I gave this game a 1 star because... I coundnt play it. It wouldn't load. I really wanted to play it because I thought it would be a great game for me. Also maybe if you have a HTC otter phone it might not load. If you know multiplication this might be a game for you! You might want to read a few more reviews and see what they say because this one might not be as helpful! Sorry if this wasn't helpful. But thank you for reading this if you got to the end! Hopfully this was helpful to you! Enjoy!,1
"Horrible game, there is an ad every single level whether you win or lose, and you have to watch ads to achieve anything",1
Too many adds never ganna play this game again.....,1
Bored to tears,1
You game best but want you update So I will 1 star,1
Its bad make a better game,1
"This is a pretty fun game, but like most have said in the past, there are way too many ads. The amount of game time vs ad time is extremely unbalanced.",1
"Too many ad's, cannot play :-(",1
Ads on every click. Deleted after 5mins,1
Too much ads 🙄. Can't even finish the game!,1
Played for about 10 minutes and I think 8 of those minutes was Bitcoin adverts! Uninstalled.,1
A commercial after EVERY level.. sucks balls,1
way too many ad's,1
Not very fun and way too many adds gets boring fast.,1
Play for 10 seconds watch 30 seconds of video. Awful game!,1
Frequency of adds need to be reasonable enough for me to not uninstall an app. Asta la Vista baby...,1
Too much ads,1
Just ads every 5 seconds,1
Ads on each level cash cow game,1
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🖕,1
Very bad game with more add then game!,1
Full of ads,1
Worst app ever. Screw those adds,1
Not so much fun i got bored in few time it is nice but ads still need to devlop about ads and make it fun,1
"Fun game, but the amount of ads is ridiculous! They keep pushing other games to play, and you can't x out to go back to the game. A game for fun turned to stress, not worth it.",1
"To many ads, boring in general",1
This game is absolutely trash 🗑 😒 even though I'm good at math and I hate how it says the among us skin is the best no body likes among us genshinimpact is better,1
Only adds,1
Acha gane ha,1
"There is no game, it is just ad spam",1
Waaaay too many ads.,1
Ads are common we can't do much Coming to game there is not much skill needed to solve every level is almost same (nothing new in terms of difficulty) and it lasts for 10 seconds and another level that's it... Nothing new or difficult,1
Easy and pretty satisfying but you genuinely spend more time watching ads than playing the game,1
lots of adds.,1
Poor loads of adds,1
ads☹☹☹,1
This game is a scam! This game is supposed to be easy. But it lags so bad I can't even move so how am I supposed to move?,1
Waste of time glitches alot to many ads boooooooooooo uninstalled,1
THE ABSOLUTE WORST GAME ON THE PLANET. ADS ARE RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!! TOTAL SCAM MONEY GRAB. Wish it wasn't so bad with the ads so I could actually play it.,1
Too many ads,1
You spend more time watching ads than playing the game. And when you decline watching an ad to get something you have to watch an ad anyway. Don't waste your time.,1
To many adds in-between every game there was an add that made it unenjoyable for me.,1
bore,1
"Instantly an ad after each round, aweful",1
Too many ads 🤬,1
It would probably be fun if there wasn't such a bad lag every time you did anything.,1
"Not only are there too many ads, the majority of the ads are 30 seconds long. Currently uninstalling",1
Ads are like a Covid19,1
Too much ads. Really annoying.,1
too much ads,1
I will give 1 star because there are too many ads it waste my time,1
Trash,1
Its good but I don't like the influence of it in my life,1
play......ad.....ad.....ad...ad....play,1
could not stand freezing throughout game play,1
"Every 5-10 second game, the user is forced to watch a 30 second ad. Ha. Good luck keeping people interested. What absurdity.",1
GUYS Turn of the Internet & then play the games which have too much ads . EASY PEASY,1
too many ads,1
To easy,1
It's boring and uninspired,1
hf,1
I hate ypur game,1
Adds all the time. More ads than gameplay,1
"Game never really gets challenging, nothing but ads, don't want to watch an ad to retry a level because you can't zoom in to move the pin you want? Well here, watch this ad instead.",1
I like you game,1
Worst each and every second ad,1
"One word ""ads""",1
"The ""game"" is designed to only watch advertisment. Levels are short, watch an ad. You ""unlock"" something? Great. Now watch this unskipable 30 sec advertisment or your ""reward"" is lost. The app is basically a advertisment simulator with 5 sec of gameplay in-between.",1
I will remove this game because of extra ads. It disturbs.,1
Too much advertising,1
Forces you to watch an add after each round. Horrible design.,1
Ads,1
Its way to laggy and i have 5 bars of wifi,1
To muck ads every single time I play One match fix it please,1
Far too many ads. It's infuriating.,1
Chitiya app hai,1
Ads ads ads,1
Ads are bad,1
Too many ads!!! Toooooo manyyyy aaaaads!!!!!!!,1
Garbage 'game' made purely as a platform for ads,1
"I got the amoung us skin then deleted, horrible game.",1
Stop having so much adds it ruined my fun in that game!!!!😡😡😡😈😈😈🎅🎅🎅 Merry Christmas😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇<3<3,1
So many ads like 2 or 3 per level,1
Too much annoying ad..!,1
"This app is ridiculous. The actual game is quite good but there are ads every 10 seconds. For every option, there is an ad",1
Start nice but then becomes too slow and game become intrupted,1
Too many add n I got boring when play with this game,1
Too many ads and notifications,1
Agigu agugi,1
Too many ads.,1
"You're too greedy with the ads. An ad after every level is too much, uninstalled.",1
To many ads,1
Bad Said it cuz ads,1
garbage,1
Hate the ads,1
Ads interruption interferes with game play entirely. 90% ads & 10% game play.,1
Not enough ads damnit,1
Too many ads,1
"Avoid, number of ads are inasane. Unplayable.",1
Unplayable because of the ads 😠,1
Two minute ads after every round which is basically 30 seconds of gameplay. Terrible.,1
It keeps crashing and I end up losing due to it all the time not worth downloading.,1
Too many ads. Get rid of them.,1
Awful,1
Ad's. Uninstall,1
"too much ads, play 10 seconds game, watch 30 seconds ads.",1
Soo many ads its aggressive and suffocating It's like the goal is to force an ad down your experience without your consent Its like the person monetizing this turned annoying ad mode to 11/10,1
I think they need more ads,1
"Ads, the game",1
Too many ads. why are there ads after each level?! It is just annoying and frustrating,1
"Ads after each level, no ability to skip easily. Ads are generally longer than the levels. Avoid.",1
More time spent watching ads than playing? No thanks,1
BAD GAME 😬😬😠😠,1
Same reason as the one below and above me! ads ads ads...,1
Very bad more add,1
Idiot games,1
An ad after EVERY SINGLE level? Hard pass.,1
Actually i don't know if it's network or something but it's so slow and disorganizing it really makes me mad but i dont really know how to put it tho..please if it's you guys doing it please make it better i really love the game but it's misbehaving,1
Tja,1
"Sorry, but ten second chunks of gameplay broken up by thirty second ads isn't my idea of a good time. It's also not engaging or satisfying enough for me spend money getting rid of the ads.",1
"Full of ads, every 15-20 sec. Greedy",1
Trash,1
IT WONT UPDATE,1
Nothing but ads,1
Garbage game. Adds all the time. Don't download,1
"Too any ads. An ad after each stage is insane! Especially when stages literally last 10 seconds, same as the ads. You can't possibly enjoy a game of which 50% of your time playing it, you're watching a random ad.",1
"Too many ads to lay the game, a level last 15 seconds and you get blasted with 1 or 2 ads.",1
"This is not a game, it's only an ad.",1
"The worst part of this game is the number of complaints about too many adds, yet they still have way too many adds. The number of adds is absolutely horrible, and the developers not doing anything about it tell me none of their other games will be worth installing. Uninstalled and avoiding developer.",1
Ads after every level are worst. 0 stars if I could.,1
"Installed, saw a huge number of Ads. Uninstalled",1
"Awful. Ads after each level(levels last about 5 seconds each, unskippable adverts last about 2min)",1
I understand the want to monotize on your creation. But a 50 second ad every 30 seconds is obscene.,1
Just call it ad watcher the game,1
Wouldnt be too bad if it wasnt nothing but ads. Uninstalled within 5 minutes.,1
x😠😡😠😡😠😡,1
Good game but so many ads man,1
Littrely not even 30 seconds into the game got an unskippable 30 second ad. That ad was longer than I even played...,1
"Unfortunately as with all games of this ilk, you spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game",1
"Not a good game, very basic strategy (Pick the biggest number.) And lots of ads. I don't recommend it. The game is super glitchy and overall boring. Sorry this was so harsh but I'm really just telling the truth...",1
Too many adverts,1
"60% watching ads (must), 40% playing game.",1
Too many ads,1
Neruthe poda pati,1
"Short levels, long ads. Even if you manage to x out of the ad at the 5 second mark every time, you'll still spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Pass",1
"VERY INAPPROPRIATE! When I first played, I saw an advert showing to people having sex. Watch your child while they are playing this because not only where they having sex but one of the characters (the girl) said in THAT kind of voice/moan ""mmhh, you do it hard baby"" and showed more sexual content! It was disgusting. Horrible game ads very sexual, the next ad was the same ad the one I just talked about. THEN THE AD EXTENDED AND SHOWED MORE OF THE AD AND UT WAS THE AD WHERE YOU CANT EVEN SKIP IT!",1
Way toooooo many adds,1
"It is malware, they deleted my review detailing everything DO NOT INSTALL",1
Totally unplayable! Add popping up literally after every level.,1
Nothing but adds,1
Bae game,1
Full of ads.. Disappointed,1
Long ad after EVERY 20 second game + more to advance? No thanks,1
dud,1
This game was so lag at my phone and I always kick but I don't do anything bad O My GOST!,1
Bulokk,1
Mucha publicidad,1
"An ad after every action you make, which is often unable to skip or fast forward. The early levels at least are really obvious number choices. I wish I hadn't installed it in the first place.",1
90% adds,1
It's just ads basically non-stop,1
Adds make it suck,1
"Is this a game, or ad watching platform? Really couldn't tell.",1
"Too many ads. One ad after every level, typically 30 seconds and unskippable. They also trick you into clicking buttons which play ads by changing the buttons on GUIs to do different things",1
"It force us to view the ads and there is no way to click close before the ads end. The control motion is bad, the game suppose to be simple and relax to play but it is really bad.",1
"Ad after every level, game sucks",1
I don't know if is possible to see more ads that what you get in this game. Is 99% adwertising and 1% game,1
"Terrible game, add after every round of game played, runs slow and laggy",1
Too much ads,1
ads ads ads and ads again. trash,1
Unbearable adds. Nightmare. Bad game,1
A complete disgrace. Too many adds.,1
So ridiculous,1
The ads make this game insufferable,1
Way too many adds,1
Lol legit finished the very first level to get a raid shadow legends ad that you can't close out of at all. Already a 1 star game.,1
Like everyone I deleted it after 10 mins there is just too many ads you spend longer watching the ads than you doing paying such a disgusting way to make money tricking people to play a game but fill it with ads and no game play should be shut down,1
Too many ads,1
Bad,1
Very bad. Kids game,1
"Its laggy and annoying, it crashes often",1
Way too many ads,1
Multiple adds.,1
This game is so dad you can't even go to the top,1
Ads every second,1
"Should have listened to others and should have known better. Figured it couldn't be all that bad, but it really was. I really think they should rename the game to ""Ad Masters.""",1
It took so gosh danm long to download,1
Bad,1
Well every time I make it to 200 it kills me so I wish we could jump and dodge,1
Soo many apps!,1
"Very worst app,too much ads irritated",1
Zero challenge or thought put into the levels. Just an obvious throw as many adds in your face money grab.,1
Too many ads😤,1
If you're downloading the game play with the internet off to spite the devs for making unskippable 30 second ads every 10 seconds of gameplay.,1
Ads every single round... Bleah,1
Dont need an add after every level,1
Literally one minute of ads per 10 seconds of gameplay. THE WORST APP EVER!!,1
Tooooooo many ads,1
Ads ads ads. Not an actual game. It's an ad grab with mere seconds of gameplay. Full 30 second ads constantly and when it's not a long ad then you get 2 or 3 short ads in a row. Only worth playing if you're willing to turn off data while you play,1
Iklan gilo babi,1
This game is more chinese than a math competition,1
"Ad after every single level, not worth it",1
downloaded just to rate one start for your annoying stupid as hell ads,1
Too many ads!,1
"Too many ads, for each and every level, sometimes two ads per level !!!",1
Wrost game ads are more that the levels,1
Silent game no sound,1
I hate ti,1
👎,1
Sucks,1
There are 30 second ads after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL OR BUILD!!!! It is so anoying I deinstaled it the same day!!!,1
Have to watch an ad every 5 minutes is ridiculous. Every level you watch an ad.. I get that ads help pay for games but this is overboard .. not worth playing.,1
Every action performed requires ad watch. Between every action requires ad watch. If you try to close the game to uninstall because of ridiculous amount of ads—you have to watch an ad. Not worth your time.,1
Way too many ads. If you're that desperate for money get a job.,1
AD every time you complete a lvl.,1
There are way to many ads and this game is nowhere near the ad i saw on youtube. Screw you,1
"Great game far to many adverts to be enjoyed. Tried again and spend more time watching advertising than playing. Uninstalled, shame it looks like a good game.",1
Woof,1
Game create to watch Ads,1
Very happy,1
Because there are ads every time when you finish a level,1
Worst game,1
Too many ads,1
"Good game, but spend more time watching ads than playing, greedy devs",1
Trash,1
Ads after every level. Why?,1
"It's all ads. 10 sec game play, 30 sec ad.",1
I hate it,1
Way too many ads,1
"So many ads, it makes it un-enjoyable.",1
"1 star, unexeptional Istarted playing weeks ago and after a few days I started to get ads after every level, it startde to really annoy me so after this review I'm deleting the app, not recommended for the impatient",1
Chata game in the world,1
This is the application of Ads which include game as a bonus,1
too many ads worst experience don't go with this,1
Spend more time in ads than game. Uninstalled.,1
Can't even play game cuz if the ads,1
👎🏽 Game isn't nearly fun enough to tolerate all those annoying ads...looks more fun then it truly is. Sorry not sorry.,1
Every level is the same got bored,1
"Too many adds, like I can deal with ads but this just silly. Fun little game, and I would pay for it rather than watch ads. But as is, unplayable.",1
Boring every level add crashes devices boring not reccomended,1
Dont install waste ur times so many ads,1
Not good,1
so many ads,1
"They made it seem like an actual decent app and I gave it a try and after every 10 second level, they force you to watch a 30 second ad",1
I struggle to call this a game. Its more like one long string of ads with a bit of game mixed in,1
Game is simple as a stick of wood. You don't really need to think about counting anything. And there's an ad after every battle...,1
You get an ad after every game. And every game is like 5sec,1
Can't do anything without being bombarded with ads....ad overkill.... don't download!!!,1
Fun game WAY to many ads,1
Trash,1
Game is alright but could you please add more ads. I don't think the game has enough. Perhaps maybe halfway through a level? Or double up in the ads every time you swipe? And perhaps more 60sec ads that have triple and quadruple wait times for the 'X' 🤦 Not enjoyable at all do to the massive amount of ads. Waste of time --delete,1
Full of spammy ads,1
"Your game has potential. But the thing is, your game is so laggy and when it lags my troops skipped the multiplier and I died easily. And whenever I pass a level the ads is everywhere, it's so annoying ☹",1
"Fun game but the amount of ads make the game unenjoyable. You get a ad at the start and at the end of every level, as well as to unlock things you have to watch a 30 sec ad. I understand the need to have ads for a free game but this is ridiculous.",1
Too many ads,1
Ads ads ads the game is an ad,1
To much ads.. very bad and so irritating game coz of ads. It's too much,1
This worst game only no one download the game only ads adds,1
Omg... so full of ads...,1
"Ad-trash game, don't waste your time.",1
ADDS ADDS ADDS just as much Adds as game play,1
"Looked good on the feed but during first game after seeing constant ads, I uninstalled straight away. Shame.",1
I uninstalled this after two minutes (like other games by this studio ) SO MANY ADS!!!! PLEASE STOP!!!,1
"LAME, JUST LIKE YOUR LAME ADS!!!",1
"Game doesn't even open anymore, waste of time spend more time watching ads than playing and game just ceased to even open all of a sudden.",1
Just way to many ads,1
Very bad game and so waste my m b and time,1
"It's ok, but then you get slammed with ads. Not just one every other round, but after every round. Even if you're not trying to get bonus coin or items or whatever. Not worth is because for every 10 seconds of play you have 20-40 seconds of ads. It's understandable if it were long runs or Eben better quality graphics, but it's not.",1
Very tatty game,1
Too many ads. Start the game get and ad. Finish a level get an ad.,1
10 seconds of playing and 2 minutes of adds. Horrible,1
90% of the time spent in the app is watching ads,1
Too many ads I'm unstalling the game don't download waste of time with stupid ads not a good game I'm very disappointed shame on the developer.,1
Awful. Tedious game with no progression. Coins and diamonds are gained but nothing to use them on - very lazy programme designing. So many ads. Again to no end.,1
"The game seems fun. Its simple to learn. However, there are too many ads. I couldn't even enjoy learning the game because there is an ad every min. I rather just play for the game, but that was not an option",1
It takes out your stress,1
"Would be fun, BUT THERE ARE ADS AFTER EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING. So stupid. Spending half the time watching ads. Can't even pay to get rid of them.",1
Too many ads! The game is good for a few runs but as others have said the ads ruin it. I installed Imit about 10mins ago and it's getting deleted,1
Everything has ads,1
Ads,1
It is unplayable because of the ads. Literally! Ads are also unskippable.,1
Just ads,1
Very bad experience Playing 1000 level not achieve to rank,1
Same thing over and over you can never get to the top of the stairs. Annoying,1
2 ads after every 10s round is serious overkill Don't bother downloading,1
"This game is so hard, way too much for my two braincells to process/s",1
Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many ads. After EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. There's an ad,1
Ad hell,1
Destroyed by adverts.,1
A lot of ads,1
Fun game with absolutely way too many advertisments.,1
after finish watching ads the game black screen.. i will not DL this again..,1
"I don't leave reviews, but this game deserves the lowest possible rating out there. If you play this you will spend at least as much time watching ads as you will spend playing the game. This game is bogus and the scumbags making it are money hungry idiots. Seriously, making a game like this should be against Google's terms of service. They should be forced out of business if they are going to make games like this. The gameplay itself is okay and mildly entertaining. Too bad its made by losers",1
Omg this is horrible it so hard😢,1
Tired of seeing ignorant gameplay so I'm docking games to 1 star.,1
"Ads with some gameplay, got bored after 5 minutes, 4 of those watching the ads",1
10 seconds of game play for a 20 second ad?,1
crashed always,1
Full of ads; not worth the time.,1
Every time is advertising. You are spending your time on advertising. Even the time that you are playing is less then the time that you are watching advertising. So I don't prefer,1
To many adverts,1
"when i picked 100+, it just stayed as 1. plus, there are too many ads. whenever i finish a round, theres an ad.",1
the sensitivity to moving around the stick figures is so low. and its riddled with ads. uninstalled after 1 game and 3 ads,1
I love ads,1
The ads are just too much. It would be better if it was an ad every three rounds or something. Uninstalled,1
Horrible add experience,1
قسم دين@#$@#,1
Too many ads,1
"I've never played this game, but the ad for it is so annoying that I would never in a million years download the game.",1
Not bad,1
"This game is trash. This is not a game with some ads, this is an ads app with some game. You can always tell when creators make an app for the sake of money and ads with zero efforts and creativity.",1
More ads than gameplay,1
ads with a game on the side... game not bad tho... turn off wifi and reboot game free no ads,1
Don't get this game. Unless you enjoy commercials. You spend twice as much time watching commercials as you do playing the game.. Each level is about 20 seconds in the beginning and the commercials can be anywhere from 10 seconds to one minute.. Pretty lousy,1
So bad😑😑😑,1
Ad every 15secs. Annoying.,1
No no no,1
"Do not and i repeat do NOT play this game. Every so called ""level"" is only about 15 seconds in length with an ad between every single one. This game is nothing but a blatant cash grab",1
A simple sliding finger game...that lags! Each level can take 5 seconds to complete with 20 second ads after each level. Really bad.,1
Game is noce but full of adds...just adds,1
Not as fun as I thought it would be. The bad thing is their are always very long ads.,1
It's one of the worst game I have played I don't even know why I'm leaving even one star every time I complete a level there's an add and it's math is defo wrong.,1
So many glitches,1
"The ads in this game are horrendous, after every level a 15 to 30 sec ad. Want to upgrade? Ad. Want these bonus 100 diamonds? Watch this 30 sec ad. Premise of the game is great I like that but I would avoid this as its awful.",1
Way to aggressive monetization strategy,1
Stupid ads takes away the fun,1
It sucks Same levels and no real goal,1
Agressive ads. Im kust trying to learn the game and im already 7 ads in. Some ads crash the game. And you gotta reload and rewatch the ad. Lol that made me delete the game.,1
Too many ads,1
Oh my gosh...the ads. Let me play at least a couple levels. Uninstalled after 20 minutes and only 5 levels.,1
WAY TOO MANY ADS!!,1
Absurdly offensive blatant ad platform.,1
Good game but terrible interface. Too many ads after each round makes it frustrating Don't download at all,1
Full of ads. Useless,1
Too many adds,1
Why does a simple game need a privacy policy? Suspicious,1
Nothing but Ads. Literally after every round. Don't waste your time,1
Very laggy and theres an ad between each level,1
To many advertisements and ads on this game. I can't barely play this game with all the ads. About 3 to 4 ads per level is ridiculous.,1
"Ads nonstop, do not download",1
"Way too many ads. A free app is allowed to have ads every so often, but after every like 10 second game, there is an ad. That is just too much and ruins all these cheap and lazy games that obviously take minimal effort to make and are just to funnel ads to the user.",1
"This game would be fun without all the ads. Beat a level and you get two choices, watch an ad for more coins or dismiss and watch an add, then go to next level. Either way, you have to watch an advertisement. Some of the diamond videos don't pay out, so they waste your time maybe three out of ten videos. It's such nonsense! Don't waste your time. I mean they even run ads for Count Masters as you're playing it.",1
Too many ads,1
Less a game. More an ad viewing platform. Uninstall,1
"Pretty much everything said here. This is a 30 second ad tape on repeat with a little fun game in between repeats. Then there's a couple of things that make no sense, the build facility which allows you to fill boats and ""send attacks"" with them. What's the reward or added value here? Also, what's the added value in collecting diamonds as these are good for nothing if one already has all the skins? The cherry on top of the cake is no quit button. Very poor and uninstalled. Do NOT recommend.",1
Ads ads ads ads ads ads,1
Too much add after each stage clear. User move also not smooth.,1
too many ads,1
too many ads make me pissed off,1
To many adverts ridiculous. Would pay for this game if I could,1
Kase nag lalag pag madame yong tao ang Daya tapos nag lalag din sa mga malaking kalaban pag Madame 😡😡😡,1
Add galore,1
Would be a super fun game but all the ads ruin it. Delete,1
Adds adds around every corner to many adds,1
"Minimal gameplay. Lots of ads. Game thinks the players are r*tarded, because it automatically highlights the correct path. Because clearly the primary objective is to watch ads not to excercise brains.",1
Nice Ads you dumb devlopers,1
"सालो, कमीनो game चलाने को दिया ह या add देखने को।। 20 mnt में 50 तो add आ जाते हैं",1
Why one star? Because this game is bad,1
LOVE the game to many damn ads deleted less than an hour later.. LESS ADS,1
🖕,1
There is ad after every single level. It takes maybe 15 sec to finish a level. The ads are at least 20 sec. Don't waster your time with this trash,1
1 minute rounds for 2 minute adds each level. No thanks.,1
Way to many ads,1
Game itself is good but why would anyone waste their time watch this number of ads...life is too short.,1
Adds adds adds,1
Are you able to play in another country or are you just stuck in the United States?,1
لعب مسنس نصنوي نينني مبىنبنب هيهتيي هيه 🌿,1
An ad after every level seriously?,1
"Far too many ads which take all the fun out of the game experience, uninstalled.",1
ADS EVERY LEVEL. SCUMBAG MONEYMAKING APP,1
Too many ads the game isn't all that fun,1
"Uhhhhhhhhhhg every 15 seconds an add, even during a level I had to stop and watch an add.",1
0/10. Waste of time. Not recommended. There are TOO MANY ads. Boring gameplay and it's super laggy. Totally a waste of your life. Only made for people under the age of 2.,1
Waste,1
Too many ads,1
"No skill needed, not challenging, add after every level.",1
Too many adds! Pls stoopppp,1
"Without a doubt the worst game ever. An Ad after every level, give me a break. Do better!!!",1
"Absolutely horrible, literally advert spam beyond worth the stress of playing lmao. Don't download it peeps 🤣",1
Dogshit,1
Full ads everywhere and everytime.,1
Too much ads. Nothing attractive to play this game. Shouldn't download it.,1
Ads are too often,1
"The game is fun however, too many adds . One right after the other.",1
Turn on airplane mode and the ads won't show,1
terrible.,1
Ad after ad,1
Ads after each and every SHORT level. All levels are short.,1
im so disappoinsted... i was expecting a tall dommyu mommy... andf noiw im left horny with no anser. up. set.,1
The game Is rigged. You can't get anything past a 4.8 and there is way to many ads. This game is just a scam so the developers can make easy money off of 2 year olds that have their parents phone. When you try to upgrade you'll have to watch an ad after buying the upgrade once. I'd rather bury my own mother than play this game.,1
I had problems the game wouldn't respond when I try to hold and move like I wasn't even playing.,1
"I get you need ads to make money but Jesus an ad after every level it's quicker to close the game and reopen to play the next level, shame because its a good time waster game",1
"Way to many adds, after a completing one course (roughly 30 seconds to complete) then having to watch adds for 15 seconds after each one is ridiculous. Could be a great game if you were actually able to enjoy it. I get it adds are how you make money but it shouldn't be at this rate. Anyway completely ruined the game for me",1
"15 seconds of play, 15 minutes of forced ads",1
Ten seconds of game play then 20-30 seconds of ads. Not exactly riveting. The game would be fun with less ads.,1
"This game could be so much better, what is the need for an add after every level? Puts you off playing the game to sit and watch 30second adverts every 1 minute",1
I give it a 1 star cus it is super laggy and is full of ads 1 out of 5 do not recommend,1
I really like this game. But what I hate is playing a game the being bombarded by loud commercials you can't turn the volume down on,1
WAY WAY WAY TOO MANY ADS!!! Every level you have to deal with so many ads it takes all the fun out of the game and has turned me off big time,1
So many ads you can't even play it. 3 ads between every level and if you click you get sent to the play store. Terrible because it has potential to be fun.,1
deleted it cause of sooo many ads.,1
"I played this game for so long trying to reach the top of the stairs. I noticed no number gets you past 6.2. When I got 200 stickmen at the end, I would land on 6.2 and even when I had 290 stickmen. I kept thinking I need to have more stickmen at the end. I noticed the game avoided me ever getting anything about 298. Eventually, I had 397 ☺️, but it reduced my stickmen after crossing the finish line and I still landed on a 6.2!!!! I'm very competitive so this really put me off. I'm deleting.",1
"Worst app I've ever tried. Loud, unmuteable ads after EVERY single lever (less than 10 sec long - the levels, not ads). Stay away at all cost!",1
"Trash game made just to make money, gameplay is just move finger too big number, adds too often to even play",1
Kys,1
"Awfully ad ridden, with no real value, no strategy or educational value. Is all for ads, nothing for the player.",1
"Game should be called ""Ad Master - 30sec Gameplay in between""",1
This game has a stupid amount of ads and absolutely no way to purchase a ad free version. I get games need ads for revenue but for every 15 seconds of game okay you get 45 seconds of ads. It's rediculous.,1
It's just an ad,1
"A bland, lazy, uninspired method of application for ads. This isnt a game. Its a way for the devs to sit there on their butts while they recieve ad revenue. Theres no love no inspiration. This product was made for the sole purpouse of making money, and frankly id expect the devs to be perfectly fine with that",1
"The game is ok, but some of the ads can't be made quiet. I can't use an app that allows this",1
Bkvas game ha,1
I like this game,1
😭 😭 😭 😭 😭😭😭😭😭 😭 😭 😭 😭,1
"I get, so. Many. Ads. For this game. Ain't played it but looks shite.",1
It's like the developers had all their friends and family rate it 5 stars so the average rating can be high. TOO MANY ADDS. You spend 10 seconds playing a level and then 15 watching an ad after each level. Not worth it.,1
Too many adds,1
"Too many ads, and also bad optimized when you have large numbers",1
"A little bit of fun with big ads, ads that require 3 clicks to get away from, I lasted about 10 minutes, uninstalled, thanks anyway. Looking further through the reviews I see the developer NEVER responds, so it is just an ad farm.",1
"Stages are too short to enjoy. Unplayable. The game concept is the best, but playing for its 10 second stage VS a 30 second ad made me to uninstall.",1
"10 sec run, 30 sec ad",1
"What more can I say that already hasn't been said? The game is a subpar money grab. Great for a minimal viable product /proof of concept, but it should have never gotten this far...",1
I like this game but don't like have many adds😠😡😠 so now I uninstalled this game. . Because I hate many adds,1
😀😀,1
"Trash, ad every 5 seconds.",1
"Too many ads, I'm not against ads but an ad after every level? That's just bs",1
Ads galore almost completely unplayable,1
I give 0 star but their is not option for 0star,1
Ad after every level,1
TAKE TOO MUSH STORAGE AND USELESS GAME!!,1
"I saw a ad for this game and decided to play it and I gotta say it's a waste of time, because unless your like 3 years old and don't know how to do math that's the only way this gave will be difficult for you this game doesn't get harder and the obstacles it adds barley make it even harder if it sped up or something it would be harder and more fun",1
Way too many ads,1
"Too many ads and is literally built for children under the age of 6, I downloaded it expecting the worst and I got the worst. If your IQ is under 100 then this would be educational.",1
Sooooo bad i hate it so much 😒 🙄,1
Too many ads. The matches are short and only last about 25-30 seconds or less. You end up watching 1 to 2 minutes of ads for every 30 seconds playing the game. It really sucks because it looked like a fun temple run-type game that would help keep my mind sharp with math.,1
This game is awesome but way too many ads,1
Ads irritating,1
"Boring game where you just move your finger back & forth across the screen. Even worse are the ads that take longer to play after each few second round of the game. I don't play other fighting games, so I have nothing to compare this with. But just dragging a finger back & forth to move a large fighting crowd is boring. Reward for fighting is coins & diamonds that're used to pay for buildings & other things. No point to this game, except to watch ads so the developers can earn real money!",1
bad cant move,1
"OK game, but how many ads can you sit through???? About every 15 seconds for an ad followed by 20 seconds of game play...only download this if you want an app for watching adverts!",1
Worst game,1
Dumb,1
Game is great. Ads ruin it to the point where its just annoying to play it. Clear money grab.,1
Literally an ad after every level,1
Non-stop ads,1
"Too many ads, they easily take up half or more of the gameplay.",1
"20% easy repetitive game play, 80% adds.",1
"It,s NOT working.",1
It's a ads game,1
"The videos for this look fun, but you spend more time watching ads then playing. Lost interest after 15mins and deleted. Waste your time like me, or look elsewhere.",1
If you love ads more than you love games then this is for you. Ad paradise!,1
"One play and I'm done, never again",1
Would have been a better rating if there wasn't a ad after every round. Don't get unless you like ads.,1
Game is OK. Just got bored of it. Uninstalled.,1
This game is very ugly 😞 game because I install and it's 100 it's installing again,1
Way too many ads. Becomes frustrating to play.,1
His e,1
Waaaaaay too many ads. Literally one after every single level. Not worth the time.,1
Terrible game experience because of too many ads,1
"This game offers me a skin for an ad, you can watch the ad and get the skin but you can also press ""leave it"". So I press ""leave it"" and it gives me a stupid ad. I thought that I pressed the button to watch the ad but on accident but, the game did not give skin. This game needs to lay off the ads.",1
You got a 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. If I want to watch this many ads I would watch TV after midnight.,1
The amount of ads is unbearable,1
"So many adds, every level.",1
Absolutely horrible experience with ads. We actually timed this. I got 10 minutes of play with 30 minutes of ads. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!,1
After few levels the game becomes monotonous. So I uninstalled it.,1
I hat this game,1
Just boring,1
All. The. Ad's,1
The amount of ads is insane,1
"Absolutely shocking game. We have all got used to countless adverts unfortunately, but an advert after every level ... seriously ?!?!",1
Simply too many ads to rate higher. The game itself is reasonably entertaining but is only about 1/3rd of the time you are using the app. The rest is waiting for ads to play,1
STUPID ADS!!!!!,1
Rubbish game every 20 seconds there is an ad,1
Soooooo trash,1
I downloaded this just so I could leave a review of how Terrible the ads in other games of this are...,1
Its suck its have add every minute WTH,1
too much Bored,1
Too many ads. Not worth it,1
Many ads,1
Worst game. It's not a game. Only advertisements are there in the game. Don't waste your data.,1
uh,1
"The game is infestwd with ads, gives unfair levels + opens google chrome in the middle of the game for no reason...",1
This game has an ungodly amount of advertising. More time spent watching ads than playing then game.,1
Way to many adds. Spend more time watching adds than playing the game,1
The amount of ads is disgusting.,1
Gives a lot of video advertisements.,1
"Really fun game, but impossible to play because of the ads. Every level: 30 seconds ad, every change another ad, its constant and no way to buy advert free version. Uninstalled.",1
Boring and lots of ads,1
It's really bad and glitchy,1
1 dum chutiyape wala game hai Sirf Tym kharab krta hai Land se battar hai Isko khalne se accha main mobile beach du 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎,1
This game is disgusting,1
This game sucks,1
A 30 second advert after each 30 second level. That's just ridiculous. Uninstalled.,1
"You have to watch an ad after every single level and the levels are only 10 seconds long so you are watching an ad every 10 seconds. On top of that, you can earn different skins as a reward for completing a certain amount of levels but in order to claim the skin YOU EARNED you have to watch another ad. There is an ad wall for everything on this ""game"" and I did not enjoy playing. I'm sorry but the reviews giving over 3 stars have to be fabricated.",1
Super repetitive. No point.,1
"Yet another of the plague of low effort, no gameplay, ad heavy garbage that invests the joke of a platform that is Google play.",1
More time watching ads then actually playing game. Would NOT recommend.,1
"An add after level, see you later. Delete!",1
Ads ads and more...etc,1
Every game that forces you to watch ads is trash,1
Way too many adds... Not as fun as I thought,1
Ads all the time,1
Have the worse ads and horrible playable ads,1
Ya no.,1
"F7d67fufuudgtgyt to be a good time to time, I am in gangtok, sikkim me know if you are looking for a few days, but I think I have a look at this time in meetings. to sarita, and I am fine and I am a little like a good time to time to do so in a few days ago, and I will be in touch with you, I am god to do so in order of date and location and a bit 2nd of your life and death in my job is posted by at all later cost for you and be in London on Monday morning to see how to make sure I have to go ba",1
ok,1
too easy like it just tells you exactly what to do so no point playing,1
Adverts after every level.. adverts seem to be longer than the actual game play 🤦‍♂️,1
Just ads constantly,1
I've been wanting to see this game but bad news its super laggy on my tablet it has no ads for mine because im seeing in the reviews and ppl are saying they are ads but not on mine but yeah it lags please faster it up,1
So many ads lmao,1
"Just uninstalled after a day I understand that ads are necessary, but in this app they are pretty obnoxious.",1
Very bad game,1
Too much ads. Greedy developer. Do not waste time.,1
Aids ad,1
Too many damn Ads,1
Ad after every round.,1
"1st minute after install, 30 sec ad. 2nd minute, 30 sec ad. 3rd minute, 30 sec ad. 4th minute, uninstall.",1
Terrible game. Wayyyyyyyy too many ads,1
Ad after ad after ad,1
Ton of ads makes the gaming experience an absolute time waste,1
"As others have said, i genuinely think its impossible to lose, its just an ad watching promo w 10 seconds of a cant lose game awful",1
Just don't do mobile games in general,1
Really! Do not bother to download this game. You play a level that takes maybe 10 seconds to complete and the have to sit through a 30 advert each time. This I nothing else but an advert machine. Complete and utter waste of time. Shame I can't give a negative rating.,1
Do not appreciate the attack on law enforcement!!!!! Very bad reflection on the world we live in!,1
mga putang ina nyo dapat negative five yung rate nyo.wla namang games puro advertise lng ang kingina.,1
Too many ads,1
Another Ad Stream with a simple game sandwiched between. Feels like it was designed to be simple to keep you playing so you watch more ads. Skip it.,1
Toooooooo much ad and theres a glich,1
"It's all ads. The ads after every single round last 30 seconds minimum. The round itself last about 5 to 8 seconds total. Sad, a game that helps with math ruined by greed.",1
Nice game but tooo many adds. Level and add. Nerves breaking,1
Ad after ad after ad 🙄,1
Way too many ads,1
"Far too many AD'S... Seriously after every level I complete another ad pops up, get a skin need to watch an ad. Forget watching them to pay the company's money. Played 4 levels and uninstalled. If could put 0 I would",1
So many ads,1
Unplayable with so many ads.,1
Terrible amount of ads.,1
Cannot enjoy because of unskipable 2 minutes ads,1
Too many commercials!!!,1
Very enoying to must watch adds after each level finished and for the rewards as well. So I tried the game for an hour and really would enjoy it. But ever 1 or 2 minute a 30 sec long add? No way. One will watch more adds than play. I will delete the game,1
Awful incessant ads,1
Good game but the one thing I can't stand are notifications from games asking me to play. I will play when I want and now not this. Uninstalled.,1
Hate it,1
Advert after every level I played not worth it,1
The games is the best,1
Why cant l download this game,1
Too many ads.,1
Ad farm.,1
It's not a game it's an ad,1
"I'm this close deleting this game, it's too much ads and keeps frequently crashing everytime.",1
"Toooooo MANY ads. After EVERY game, 30 secs?!!!.... that's longer than the game itself....",1
Add after every level. No way to skip or purchase full version. Pain.,1
"Basic game, 1000000 ads.",1
I gave it 1star because a lot of ads and it glitch my phone so I delete it,1
Annoying advertising,1
Good game,1
There's an ad after each level and sometimes it's long.,1
The ads made me lose all enjoyment in the game. I uninstalled after 10 mins,1
Way too many adverts,1
Too many ads,1
Ads are so bad. In the game and out of it I never played it the ads were so bad,1
Download this for ads.,1
More ads than game. 10 seconds of playtime to 30-60 seconds of ads every round.,1
Ads every 5sec makes it completely unplayable.,1
The game is mostly ads,1
One of the buggiest games that I've had the displeasure of playing. The fpm's are so low that it moves 4 frames at a time,1
Dnt play this game . Totally waste.,1
Terribly boring,1
Only one star because not enough ads instead of one after every round why not 1 before and 1 after and maybe 1 in the middle? That would be the ideal number 1 after every round isnt intrusive enough,1
way too many ads,1
I actually enjoyed the game itself but its not worth the constant ads. Totally ruined gameplay.,1
"This is another one of those cash-grabbing games, I really don't recommend playing this garbage. The ""developers"" just coded this game in less than 20 minutes.",1
"A ridiculous amount of ads, and an even more ridiculous amount of lag for such a simple game. Controls lack any actual control.",1
Ads ads and oh yeah MORE ADS,1
"An endless cycle of 10 seconds of game play followed by 30 seconds of ads. It is brutal. Cute game, but the ads make it unbearable.",1
Fun if you like watching ads every 15-20 seconds.,1
Way too many ads to be enjoyable. You watch the ads longer than you play the actual game!,1
it would be enjoyable if it wasnt so laggy.,1
"It's neat and enjoyable, but the adds ruin it. Often longer than the level.",1
I like this game but I don't like one thing about the ads almost all the game will have a lot of ads so nevermyne it's just a game you want to play or you don't want play nevermyne but you all should try the game at lease give a review 😁😄😄 it's fun,1
"POOR EXPERIENCE, PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS. RUBBISH THERE ARE MORE ADS THAN GAMEPLAY, NO OPTION TO SKIP ADS.",1
"Could be a fun game, ruined by far too many ads.",1
plese run dowload 😭😭😭😭,1
"This is a ad pusher, you spend more time seeing adds than playing",1
"Load of Poop! Every game lasts 10 seconds and in between each game you have to watch almost 2 minutes of ads!!! It's a shame because the graphics are fairly good. I understand there has to be ads, but really - this is ridiculous. Uninstalled after 10 minutes.",1
To easy and boring also many ads,1
Bad,1
"Played one level, ad. Ok let try the next. Same thing. Then AD. the ads last longer than the actual game play. Installed and deleted within 5 min.",1
"Very very bad game, WAY TO MANY ADDS HOW DO YOU RAID SOMEONE WITH ADDS IN THE FIRST 10M OF PLAYING?",1
"The adds take up at least 80% of the time using the app. Really. Like a 5 second go, then a very long 15-20 second add. Wash. Repeat.",1
"Too many ads, after each level...is very annoying",1
it's very bad,1
"If there is a star that will represent zero, I would gladly hit it 🤣. The mos annoying game I've ever had in my phone. I should've believed the reviews about ads that keeps running after finishing each level. They are correct, this is an ad that comes with a game. 🤮 🤮🤮👎👎👎",1
Tell us why,1
Please don't download it Please 😢. It's hacking tool. It took my money without informing me. Please 🙏. Play store should ban it.,1
"Way too many ads for a game that is predetermined, you can't get above a certain amount because of the saws",1
"If you like your ads to have a stickman game built somewhere within, this is the game for you! You'll spend more time looking at fake ads for other ad filled games, you'll forget that you're actually supposed to be playing a game! Should be named ""Ads! featuring Stickman intermissions!""",1
Far far far too many ads,1
"This game is very bad and very boring i am give to one star becaus for in this 👎👎👎👎👎👎 game please not install this game this game is very bad not exellent not good ,and very poor, average , not very good this game suddenly strunkling for this game please guys u will install this please not install again again i am telling please uninstall this game. this game is a good way to explain why, because not intrested you will play this automatical sleeped 😴😴 this game like 🤮 ok gyus thanks",1
Non skippable ads makes the experience worst.,1
"If you're a developer, and you choose to go with invasive ads that force people to watch videos instead of banners Sincerely you're awful.",1
No comment,1
Unskippable 3 minute ads after every round,1
"Fair too many ads, after every level there is a ad, if you need to build it requires a ad , the game forces you to watch a 30 second video every 30 seconds of gameplay ... Not worth it at all",1
The number of adds is insane. I actually thought the game and concept were pretty good. The number of ads is not acceptable.,1
Another add farm. Levels take literally 10-20s to complete and then always an add at the end and always an add to increase earnings. Immediate uninstall,1
Fun idea but the advertisement after every level is terrible. I uninstalled after two minutes of playing,1
I hate this game my brother check this and hate this my all family hate this game😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢,1
Wish I could give it no stars. Too many ads,1
Way too many ads,1
"I get the need for ads it's just too many. After each play there's an ad... And another one and another one. I can't enjoy the game. So based on that, I'm out. UNINSTALLED!",1
"This game is fun, make sure to switch off your data and internet. But it's weird, you're building things and attacking for diamonds... But the diamonds are not being spent anywhere. And when attacking you always win. There is also not a clear goal in the game. Unless the goal of the game is to bombard you with as many ads as possible!",1
Ad pusher. There is also no end to the game.,1
Adverts with a game thrown in for something inbetween them.,1
"Fun game, but ruined by ads after every level...",1
"Caution, these ads main contain gameplay. If you like some gameplay between your ads then this is not the game for you.",1
too much ads. if you turn off Wi-Fi or data then can play longer without ads but game freeze later.,1
Slow,1
"Way too many adverts. More adverts than gameplay, deleted",1
Horrible app! There are way to many adds! And it lags a lot! And there is so point of the game! And the developer doesent even respond to the reviews! Which makes the game even horrible! I 100% reccomand you to not waste ur time on this game!,1
Very adds 😭,1
After every level a ad is to much. Ads are longer than the level,1
Way to many commercials,1
Played 5 levels. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Game is garbage,1
Trrrrrraaaaaaasssssshhhhhgg,1
Keep seeing ads for this terrible game everywhere so here's what you get.,1
Way too many ads,1
Billion ads,1
"people updates are useless, it increases people you fight for the same number you update your people equally which makes the update pointless.",1
To many ads,1
Easiest game. In one word Boring 😴😴😴😴😴🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤,1
"Nice concept, but very repetitive and not varied. It also lags a lot sometimes and doesn't pick up certain movements. And on top of all of that, there is an excessive amount of ads.",1
"After every single level there's an ad most are unskippable even when you don't want their ""reward"" you're still forced to watch ads the gameplay simply isn't worth it",1
Ads ads ads. To have 10 second of game you need to watch 30 second ad. No thanks...,1
Too many add.,1
While playing its buffering and hanging always,1
I love it but why do we we have to always get to fight red one only try better to add more colors in the game,1
"Waaay too many forced ads for such a basic game, nothing but a money grab by the devs.",1
"This game is full of 1. Stolen copyrighted assets from among us, fall guys and probably more 2. Ads, with an ad while you're playing getting in the way 3. Repetition. This game is boring after 5 minutes. The gameplay is the exact same each run. This game isn't good, don't bother.",1
"Way too many ads, I can't even play the game. After one level, an ad appears. It makes me just want to leave and delete the game. I understand the point of incorporating ads into the app but it diminishes your own game with all these ads. It's not fun to play, you're viewing ads more than you are playing. Wouldn't recommend downloading it.",1
"Entirely too many ads. Spend more time watching ads then playing the game. No x to close out the stupid ads, so you are stuck waiting for them to end. Waste of time.",1
Have to watch an ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. I Uninstalled it after playing 10 minutes of playing. Obnoxious.,1
Very very very very bad game so many ads you wil waste your net in this game I willl report this game 🙄,1
"It's a good game idea, although i shouldn't have to watch an ad every time i proceed to a new level. Especially since the beginning levels are so short. It just makes players bored. I get that ads give you income but you don't need this many ads. The company/developmer(s) have like millions of downloads so a lot of people see the ads. But you don't need to have so many. We wany to play something not watch advertisements. I'm uninstalling the games.",1
FAR TOO MANY ADS PUT ME OFF PLAYING. UNINSTALLED,1
nothing but ads,1
Ads also no online saving. Uninstalled.,1
Ads not worth it,1
I love Tt,1
Be prepared to watch ads 80% of the time.,1
Faf too many ads!,1
"Like the game, but ads after every level??? No....",1
ad after every level....,1
Waaayyyy too many ads!!!,1
Ads at every level completed. More ads then game play,1
Worst,1
"It would be a simple yet fun game, if you didn't have to watch an ad every other minute.",1
I hate this game it's full of ads,1
"The game could have been fun, but the first level took about 10 seconds to complete followed by a 30 second ad. The second level took about 30 seconds to complete followed by a 30 second ad. At this point I bailed and uninstalled the game.",1
It's terrible. You have to watch an ad for every single time you play and every single level.,1
Game is nice but too much advertisement. There is ads after every level it's so irritating,1
didnt like the game,1
This app not for play game only watch adverts very big disappointment,1
Too many ads.,1
"App gave me colon cancer, too many ads!!!",1
"Solito giochino acchiappa ads, con livelli stupidamente facili, così sei costretto a passarne 1000 per avere un minimo di difficoltà...e ad ogni traguardo parte la pubblicità.",1
"Way too many ads that are longer than each short level. Game play is not challenging and its simple. The first two or three levels, yeah ok, but you need more challenging level. Did I say way too many ad",1
"I would give zero stars if that were an option. Seriously an add after you complete EVERY level?!?! And the touchy controls. If you move your finger a fraction of a hair, all your little guys are falling off cliffs, or getting squashed by whatever. This game would be so addicting if it wasnt so flawed. Seriously. Makes me sad, but i will be deleting this app. Dont waste your time in downloading or trying to play. So dissapointing. 😐",1
It's so very bad,1
Terrible,1
Ya good Game this,1
More ad than game,1
Pretty simple game. Way too many ads for how quick the game goes. Get's boring fast.,1
To much ads😠,1
This game is good,1
"Too short of levels, way too many ads to be worth it. Imma pass.",1
Uninstalled immediately.. more ads than actual play time. Too bad.,1
This game was only made to advertised Lazada.game is ok but there is ad in every level so i deleted it,1
I played for 30 seconds (if that) and watched 2 minutes of ads. Absolutely ridiculous.,1
Questo gioco esce in troppe pubblicità,1
Ad masters,1
Ads are every 30 seconds. Unplayable,1
Too many ads. Way too many.,1
"Fun game, pervasive advertising.",1
The performance îs horrible. I cannot play The game without lagging,1
SUPER,1
Too boring A lot of ads,1
Very laggy for mobile and every time you pass 2 levels there is an ad... DO NOT waste your time.,1
More ads than play time!!!,1
Too many ads.,1
This isn't even a game. It's just a load of adverts with a second of game play inbetween. Probably the worst thing I've ever downloaded.,1
Sooo many adds.....,1
Meh,1
"These kind of games (that you get off ads) are only engines to show you more ads. Okay game, WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!",1
Very easy game . You will always win!!,1
This game is not that great. It is realy boring and a lot of adds it is really not 1 star. Please change the game. It could be a really good game but it is not. 🙄🙄🙄,1
"Way too many ads, far longer than the rather simple game play. Uninstalled.",1
trash,1
Ads ads and more ads,1
Whether you beat a level or lose the level you have to watch commercial advertising then every item you win or buy you have to watch a commercial way too many advertisements no way to bypass some the heck with this game sucks,1
Greg trace Iraq is it OK to come back to work tomorrow at school tomorrow at school tomorrow at 🏫 and then we can get it for you guys are doing great 2 to yygj 7hfr 6bh h Tito heartbroken horrific,1
Crazy amount of ads.,1
"A laggy, unresponsive, poorly optimised mess. Not worth even trying.",1
"So much Ads got me stressed up, i dont need this.",1
way too many ads,1
"Agree with the other reviewers, there are far too many ads in this game, it's obnoxious. You can't skip for most of them and some of the ads don't even load, absolutely ruins the game to the point where I'm uninstalling it.",1
"Too much ads, you can only play 1 minute between 5minute long lasting ads",1
Ads for days,1
Way too many adds,1
Absolute garbage game. Nothing but ads. Don't install.,1
Littered with ads,1
horrible add,1
Too much ads,1
Dumb and stupid... no concept whatsoever,1
"Extremely repetitive game that lasts like 10 seconds, and new levels are in short redskins of the same thing",1
Ads every level. Not worth it.,1
I hate those ads😠,1
Yhis games is the worst game ive every played why do u have so many ads lime for what Like who does this thus is voing to,1
Uninstalled quickly after installing as it takes 15 seconds to complete a level and each level is followed by an advert. This is more an advertising app with the odd break for a game rather than the other way round. Would have been quite fun otherwise but I can't be bothered to play it as it currently is,1
"It just bugs so much. Was a good idea but if I see X 10 , 34 enemies, +60 it would be nice if I could do it in that order. Instead when you see X 10 you've already been killed by the enemies past the +60 🤦",1
Too many adds and it did not interest me.,1
"1 star game if not for all the shill, 1 word, 5 star ratings! Too many advertisements!",1
Ads are out of control,1
"nesty time killing ads,,🤬🤬😡😠",1
I love this game so much its so much fun.,1
𝑛𝑖𝑐𝑒,1
1:3 play ad ratio.,1
"WAY TO MANY ADS! After each level, be expected to see a little Amogus dude fill up with liquid. Less than a second later, get smacked in the face with a 30 second or more ad. This is how the game gets its revenue. Either ads, or paying for no ads.",1
Very bed gem,1
This game is plagued with ads,1
I got scammed and I payed and got nothing.,1
"Ads, Too much ads",1
More adds than gameplay,1
Not worth the ads every time I click on something. 👎,1
Adds are zoomed in so far you can't skip or close them once finished so you have to restart the app after every game.,1
Too much advertisement everytime you complete the stage,1
"Garbage ad game. It's a pointless ""game"" that exists solely to show you nonstop ads of other pointless ""games"". Not sure why most of these cell phone games are legal, but at least this one is KINDA like it's advertisement.",1
Too hard to control where they go. It should be much more smoother. The swiping is too sticky and not smooth. Uninstalled.,1
"Filth. 10s gameplay, 30s spam, 10s gameplay, 30 spam...",1
"Ads, ads and more ads. Could be good but isn't",1
Silly mindless game. I only play it when I don't want to think. I go on autopilot...,1
"App sucks. Its way to glitchy. I put my finger on the screen, and move a fraction of a centimeter, and the ""people"" shoot across the screen. Uninstaller after two rounds.",1
Too many ads. It's ridiculous,1
This a very boring and bad game do not waste your money,1
Deleted this game because too much ads,1
Way too many ads. Come on now,1
Very small levels and full of ads,1
For unsatisfying video ads.,1
The game sucks i hate it the ones who made this are people who dont know what a fun game is to be. I think the developers think we dont have any feeling or emotions. Ad after ad just a game in which you get to see only ads. This game is made for robots not humans.,1
"I don't like this game because there is like a thousand ads per second, The amount if ads are disgusting I don't know why you would like this game, Probably if you have patience, And I don't have any because I can never wait for anything for over then 20 seconds. It's really obnoxious please get them removed or there will be nobody playing your game, Hope you remove it by new year! Please do it thank you! By the way I need you to or else I will not re- download it because I am deleting it now TY",1
Way too many ads.,1
Ad after every level,1
Meh glitches,1
Supar,1
Too much add😒,1
It's still fun but I wouldnt really recommend it as it is soooo glitchy and that is so annoying. Also there are soooo many adds! There needs to be a lot of improvement,1
Too many ads.,1
Ad Farmer,1
1 lvl 1 ad....,1
"I don't know at higher levels but at low levels is preaty boring. Also, the main reason i gave 1 star: it's far more an add simulator rather than a game",1
Too many adds,1
"This game sucks. Im giving it 1 star, but it deserves 0. Not that challenging and there are unskippable ads every two seconds. I'm trying to give zero stars.",1
I have never played such a laggy game like this 👁👄👁,1
It is a horrible game you play for like 10 seconds then get a 20 second add the only reason this app is so big is because of little kids on tiktok.the only reason this game is even made is to make money.,1
The amount of ads make the game unplayable for me. Yes it is fun to make easy mathematical calculations but getting an ad every 10 seconds... Is not nice.,1
👌👌👌,1
Too many ads. Annoying,1
"Too many ads!!! Literally everything is an ad, no strategy and gets boring quick. Not worth downloading.",1
Absolutely the most aggressive and never ending ads campaign. Game forces you to watch so many ads it's not worth it at all. I want a refund on my time.,1
way too many ads.,1
Fun game but there is an ad after each level that is longer than the level was! I get the need for ads but it can't be more ads than gameplay.,1
To many bloody ads,1
Too many ads,1
So many ads,1
This game not bad,1
If you love watching advertisment after each level you are welcome,1
Oh my god I swear I am going to commit mass genocide,1
Too many ads back2back,1
Dont download this app. Full off ads,1
Too many ads,1
Everytime you complete a level it has adsb,1
There ads in everything,1
It's stupid and the controls are laggy. STOP MAKING STUPID ADS,1
it is so laggy,1
Too many ads,1
Glitchy as heck. Do not recommend.,1
Adds,1
So many Ads,1
Way too many ads,1
Occasionally you get to play between ads,1
Omg the ads. Literally every level there is an unskippable ad.... uninstalling,1
Add after every level,1
Shameless Cash Grab,1
Too many ads unplayable,1
"This is not a game, this is a platform for commercials.",1
An ad after every. Single. Level click bait that takes you to web sites.,1
Very hard f from the begining. Rubbish,1
5 second game levels followed by a 10-15 second ad after every level. Really annoying not worth downloading.,1
Nothing you can do at all. AND SO MANY ADS!! I won't install this app ever again fr,1
Too much advertising,1
It's ok ig,1
Terrible game it froze I the middle of level one then I closes my windows and beat level 1 then it showed a 30 second ad I don't recommend this app,1
Game is filled with ad's every 2 minutes waste of time to play no fun at all,1
WAY TOO MANY ADS. EVERYTIME you complete a level you are hit with ads. You spend more times watching ads then you play the game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME unless you love watching ads.,1
"This game sucks, too many ads and no point to it. Once you conquer US there's nothing else. Pointless. Could have been a great game.",1
You'd have to be stupid to watch these adverts the advert generator has,1
To many ads,1
Omg so many adverts such a shame,1
Mostly ads. You spend 90% of your time watching ads.,1
"In this game, you watch ads more than you play…",1
Boring. Way too many adverts,1
Fun game but ads after EVERY ROUND was ridiculous.,1
This is cloud master wow such a nice day I like this game very much we have a colour and we want to take much colours God so nice game I have token,1
Worst game ever,1
Countless ads,1
Ads every 25 seconds.,1
"It's fun, but it's terrible. Too many ads, and it's always lagging when you go for a higher amount....",1
Fun game. But i am forced to watch more ads then playing the game. U have like a 15s ad after every round? No way,1
Played 1 level and instantly uninstalled. Have to close the ad 3 times to get it to go away? Stupid.,1
"A game based on increasing your numbers and yet is poorly optimised for when you do get to the high numbers of just 200 units the game cant handle it, as well as the platform not having enough space for all those units or having no control over their formation to minimize your loses.",1
"Spent more time watching ads than playing the game, has irritating push notifications too.",1
Quá lắm quảng cáo,1
Didn't even get to play for more then 20 seconds without an unskippable ad that was longer then the time played.,1
"Serious issue with the ads. Even ignoring the fact that the ads are way too frequent and are longer than the actual game play, on my Galaxy S10 with Android 12 the ads are larger than the screen so the button or ""x"" or whatever mechanism you close the ad with after the ad finishes is off screen. The only way past it is to completely close the game and restart after every level. This developer is more focused on the quick buck instead of trying to create a good game and a loyal fan base. 👎",1
Too many obnoxious adds.,1
His not interested game,1
Too much ads. Hard to control,1
Far too many adverts,1
too many ads,1
Ad after every level!!! nope! Fugg you uninstalled this garbage,1
It's show too many ad,1
I give the game a one star because adverts take 5 hours to end,1
too much ads,1
"This isn't a game. It's just a series of advertisements. The ""game"" the ads are hiding behind is fairly mindless. No challenge. It's virtually impossible to lose. You'll spend 5x as much time waiting for ads to finish than actually playing the ""game"".",1
This is not a game. This is Ad watching app,1
So much advertisement that it is simply impossible to play.,1
"Way too many ads. Each level takes just a few seconds then followed by a 30 second ad. I don't mind ads, it's how I find most of my games but this is excessive. The fact that there are several reviews here that specifically state 'just the right amount of ad's' and 'creator is a genius' seems to me that these reviews are fake. Making me not trust the developer as they don't respect their users. Deleting the game now, which is a shame as I would have enjoyed without so many ads.",1
Unbelievable amount of ads. I get that you need ads to function and get money but this is ridiculous. There is an ad every 10 seconds for absolutely everything. Even to change colors or to press next.,1
So mutch ads,1
Cant stand seeing nothing but adds,1
"My first review on Google play ever, this app is retarded, adds after every level and its laggy and glitches.... Booooo",1
To see more ads than playing. Completely annoying adds,1
Too many Ads,1
This sure does get boring fast,1
"Terrible, offers no challenge and assaults you with ads.",1
Horrible weather,1
Too many ads. One ad after every stage is ridiculous.,1
This is a boring game. Are many ads! 😡,1
Waste of time,1
"Literally a game that wastes your time. You'll be spending few seconds for gameplay before you got bombarded by few minutes unskippable ads. I got baited by the promotion of the game and I just thought it was a cool concept, boy I WAS WRONG. The game has no music nor sfx other than the annoying vibration on your phone, the game itself runs laggy no matter regardless the phone type, and the nail on the coffin is ads ads ads and MORE ADS! Might as well call this count ads game!",1
"If you want to spend more time watching adds than playing the game this is for you!, personally I'm deleting it now, shame as it could be a good game",1
If you like ads this game is for you. Each round last 20 to 30 seconds and then you get 30 to 40 seconds of ads no skipping.,1
"Even 1 star is way too high rating for this app. First of all the there are so many advertisements, 2nd the game is so boring and it's literally pointless and waste of time, finally, I don't see anyone over the age of 8 not be able to beat these levels. I highly recommend to not play this game at all trust me it's worth your time.",1
Too many ads,1
Not 🚫 good,1
Ads are toooo annoying,1
Too many adverts,1
Watch ads more then play the game,1
An add enter every 15 seconds of level play.,1
I love it ❣️,1
To many ads,1
Horrible. Waste of time. Every 2 seconds you have to watch an add. It won't let your phone get out of it either. These people are thieves of my time and patience. Im un-installing right after i post this.,1
"No matter how you perfectly move those blue things, they finally go to wrong direction.",1
Too many ads. Deleted the app after 2 levels.,1
Look you see it a good game oh no it being pushed aside by a wave of bad games,1
Need more improvement. I can't say it a good game.😐,1
Literally Nothing But Ads. You spend more time watching ads then playing the games. Not to mention the ads try to make it impossible to get out of them without accidentally clicking the links to the other games. Absolutely useless and definitely never playing this game again. If I could give 0 stars I would.,1
Just horrible.,1
Couldn't even play the game it was so slow and glitchy.,1
This game glitches so bad u keep losing. Way to many issues and to many adds.,1
Worst game on the market,1
Ads are life draining!,1
Insane amount of adds,1
"End game isn't for me, far too dizzying, it needs the stairs head on for my eyes to cope. I only played 3 rounds but liked playing to that point. I have to uninstall only because of the ending, sorry.",1
"I downloaded the game to try it and it was so laggy I could not control anything. very terrible, deleted the game after 2 minutes.",1
Trach,1
"to many ads. the amount of ads in the game is literally way to much and draged me out of the experience, no fun with ads after every single level, and i highly recommend turning of your wifi and 4G.",1
"The ads in this game are straight up predatory. This is obvious shovelware aimed at small children. There are unskippable, unavoidable ads in between every single level. Even if you choose not to get a skin or whatever, an ad that can't be skipped plays anyways. There are hundreds of clones of this game, so this is obviously another cheap adware cash grab. I would look elsewhere for number games for children. TL;DR: AVOID THIS GAME: ITS JUST A LOW EFFORT AD REVENUE GENERATOR",1
This game is riddled with ads every level.,1
Hyper aggressive ads keep attacking my phone I'm done!,1
Toooooo much add,1
"Plays an ad after EVERY level, which kills the experience.An ad every few levels might be understandable but this is so annoying I uninstalled instead. Bummer.",1
I got an add in the first 10 seconds of game play Enough said,1
"Unplayable, more ads than game. Might aswell be malware",1
Too many adverts,1
"At Stage 6, it turn bugged and can't defeat da boss",1
Anoning ads all the time,1
SO MANY ADDS,1
خرا,1
Too many adverts,1
Terrible. Ad in between every very short level. Ad at the bottom too. It's just ads.,1
preetshrivas,1
First two rounds played got two 30 second ads.,1
Not sure,1
😡😡😡👎👎👎👎,1
"Great game! If you don't mind the 2 minute ads before and after the 30 second levels. In saying that, this isn't a game. Just ads with mini games, before and after it. I'd like it if was just a game with ads in it, but it's the opposite 😃🔫",1
"Uninstalled after 2 mins of play when I realized that my crowd was killing a cop. Sorry, I'm out.",1
Ads popping up everywhere so frustrating,1
"I timed it, you spend more time watching ads then actually playing the game.",1
ABSOLUTELY RUBBISH EASIEST GAME EVER ALSO TOO MANY ADS BASICALLY AN ADD AFTER EVERY LEVEL,1
Many ads for biginig downloaded game,1
"Brainless and too many ads. Seriously, a level lasts maybe 25 seconds. Every other level you will get a 30 second ad. If i wanted to watch ads i would have gone to youtube.",1
Ads . Ads . Too many ads 👎🤢 uninstalled,1
Played for 5 minutes watched the ads for 3 minutes and deleted it. What a waste of time,1
Ads spammer.,1
Probably the most honest game in the market sacrifice cost more than willing to sacrifice,1
"You scoundrels ... Wrecthed, horrid scoundrels. The ad lengths are proposterous. Boo. And after every game play, too!",1
This is ads with a mini game in-between them. Would not recommend.,1
Too many ads,1
"5 to10 seconds of game play then a 3 second ad, every time. Definitely deleting.",1
Slow and boring,1
C'mon really?!?! An ad after every single attempt? Good bye.,1
Way to many ads lags lot,1
"Low effort ad delivery system. Ads are longer than the levels and you get an ad for every one. Don't bother unless you actually are here to watch ads, not play games.",1
Too much adds,1
You play the first level then an add you can't get past. You have to close the game and restart. Worthless,1
Genuinely more adverts than game play,1
"Waste of 10 mins of my life of which 4 were adds, the game is pretty much the same lvl but props placed differently, a lvl lasts about 20 seconds and then you get an add for 7-10 seconds",1
Too many ad,1
What is the purpose of diamonds inearned,1
It's a fun game and all but the ads in between EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL is a bit too annoying for me😕,1
Most useless app. Don't waste your 60mb,1
"Terrible, bombarded with ads",1
Definitely fun but I'm not gonna sit here and watch ad after ad after every level,1
Uninstalled after seeing amount of ads and how much personal data is collected. Would have been a fun game otherwise.,1
I could id give it zero stars Seriously the most boring game ever There's nothing exciting about you have to do the same thing over and over again And the ads,1
Xgid🧟🧟🧟🧟🧟,1
way too many ads... glitchy... keeps shutting down... bad graphics... very repetitive... watch for reward or watch ad for nothing... If you like badly made games then play this!,1
When was the first time ads pop out?,1
Worst game,1
"Ads, ads, ads... Literally after every. Single. Level. Do you really need that many adverts for a game like this? How about making them.optional for some.skrt of reward, rather than force them on a player after every round. No thanks, I'm done. Don't bother wasting you're time with this one.",1
সব। পগোল মাথা খারাপ গেম,1
Bakeas,1
IF YOU LOVE WATCHING ADVERTS THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. IT'S POORLY WRITTEN AND FREEZES. OH WELL BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD,1
More time spent watching adverts than playing the game. Good game ruined by adverts all the time. Deleted.,1
Good game but the ads after each level made me Uninstall straight away,1
"AVOID!!! Utterly absolutely RUBBISH. A CON. Long ads every 10 seconds. You guys are a disgrace. Rather pathetic, selfish and just the worst kind of everything. DO NOT INSTALL.",1
"More ads than gameplay, uninstall",1
Too many bloody ads. Its rediculous! I do not recommend unoess otherwise be prepared for ads after every bloody game.,1
Toooooooo much add while paying net,1
I played for all of about 1 min then uninstalled. It seems like a decent pass time game but is NOT worth the constant add running.,1
Fulll ad,1
More ads please,1
Too many ads for it to be worth it to play,1
Heavily ad cancerous. After each level is an ad. I play 10sec and stay 20sec on an ad. Unplayable.,1
Adds,1
This game sucks i cant get pass level 10,1
Too. Many. Ads.,1
"They make it so you can't get all the people you collect past the weapons. Then when I tried to pick one to multiply, it chose the other one then the one most of them were on.",1
a ad after every level and the game is super easy,1
Been playing this for a few weeks. Noticed I could never get higher than a 6.2 on the stairs even though it shows you can get higher. You can get a 6.2 with under 300 guys. I managed to get a crowd of 600 + guys to the stairs and all I got was a 6.2. I uninstalled the game right then.,1
"Ads are beyond ridiculous. If you are a fan of ads, this may be your game",1
"The game time to ad time ratio is under 1, that's a shame. Uninstalled",1
"Horrendous. The game itself would be fine, but the ads cannot be skipped and when they finish, I can't x out without it registering as if I just clicked on it to see it on my browser or app store. Worse yet, the ads pop up after EACH little round. Because of this, I downloaded and deleted the thing in less than 5 minutes.",1
"Hideous amount of ads, some you are unable to mute, some are a video then an ad. 30seconds game play 45seconds of ads",1
This is just an app where you watch ads for games you don't want to play and in between those ads you get to play a game 15sec at a time... A game that doesn't get challenging no matter how long you can endure the ads.,1
Very disappointed with the game to ad ratio. 20 seconds of dull gameplay followed by 30-45 second ads.,1
"Terrible game, too much advertisments. For each 15 seconds of a game there's 40 seconds ad. I deleted the game after 10 minutes (which 9 of them i spent on waiting)",1
"This was one of the dumbest games i have ever played, and thats saying something. I read the other reviews beforehand but ignored them thinking they were probably wrong, BAD IDEA! This game was so lagging, non-stop ads, and honestly just boring. I quickly unistalled the game. 10 mins WASTED from my life. Just horrible.",1
Good,1
10 Secs of Game with along ad in between each level... awful 😖,1
The worst game I ever play way to many ads and I die for no reason 😡😡😤😠,1
Would be a fun game if you weren't continuously forced to watch ads. You have about 20 seconds game play followed by 10 seconds of ads. Then around 30 seconds of ads at the end of each level (so 30 seconds of ads for 1minute of gameplay). It's just too much - uninstalled,1
Pura publicidad es insoportable,1
"This game sucks,has more adds than play time physically impossible on 13 % of the level.At lv.20 i did times 2 of lv.19 and i somehow got 1x multiplayer.",1
nope i hatee this so much because i already know this and here was so muh ads y'know and i dont like it im not just a personal person but its really so emberrising or something but i say it i can do this 5 stars if you remove the ads:),1
"There are 10000 ads, even if you click ""later"" it will still give you an ad",1
Way too much ads,1
ads and more ads and when you think it's time to play more ads,1
Let me watch tik tok with out ads,1
"Awful advert farming game, unchallenging and boring. Exists just to farm ad revenue, takes about 5-10 seconds to clear and level and then you watch 5-30 seconds of adverts. Worst mobile game I've ever come across.",1
"The amount of ads inside of this game are genuinely infuriating. I get it, sure, this is a nice game and the concept is fairly basic and simple to understand... But please for the love of our spirits stop shoving ads into our faces every other level! Advertisements should be optional yet rewarding, forced advertisements should not sustain your game and your downloaders are people, not a bunch of numbers. Maybe if there were less ads, people would be more willing to share this game with others.",1
This game gets very laggy when I control a little lot of people which makes me lose almost all of my group people. It is very annoying.,1
"I hate this game, Before you fownlod this game, please chek the comment",1
Too many ads.,1
Fun but after like 8 seconds it an ad! Sorry to say but deleting.,1
I am playing off an acer chromebook and it wont even let me move even to mention that it randomly stopped and pauses. there was a negitive amount of playing 90% of it was adds like come on most games i play arent like that I dont recommend the game :(,1
4 second levels with 1 min commercials in between,1
No privacy and yet more ads than the game itself,1
Too many ads. Sooo annoying..,1
I played one game only but had to watch 3-4 ads 😃,1
To much ads would be a good game if ads every 2 or 3 games and only 5 second ads not 30 seconds 😡🤬,1
To many ads,1
Too much of adds.,1
I am ml player,1
Game is full of un necessary ads,1
5s playing 30s ad,1
This is sooooo bad it is lagy I'm removing it,1
Those ads suck,1
Ad monster . Nonestop like a virus .. its crazy .,1
Too many ads. I deleted the app after 2min playing. 👎,1
"Way too many ads, only wants to make money. If it were more than just an endless amount of easy levels it would be better.",1
"The constent advertising of other games is ridiculous, puts you right of playing this game .. its crazy .. Do not waste your time with game.. GREEDY VERY GREEDY , WE ALL CANNOT BE WRONG IN THE REVIEWS SECTION.. SURELY NOT ...! OOPS BE CAREFUL , HERE COMES AD NOW IN REVIEW ...! 🤬 IM 😠 OFF 😠 OUT😤 OF🥱 HERE",1
"You get like 10 seconds play and then have to watch 30+ seconds of repetitive ads. Waste of time, boring game anyway",1
"Awful game by scumbag developers. Levels are (and I'm not exaggerating) 10 seconds long. Every single level is followed by an ad that is 20 to 30 seconds long. When the ad is finished, you must click the X to continue. But clicking the X often just takes you to the link for downloading whatever was being advertise. I say again, the developers are absolute scum.",1
1 sta... sorry ad... as I was saying 1 star for ... sorry another ad... where was I.... sorry another ad... so it gets one star for... sorry another ad... grrr this is .... sorry another ad... omg lemme finish... sorry another ad... 1 star ads all the time... sorry another ad... f this game.,1
"Just as you start to get rhythm going, an ad for another game opens up. Huge waste of time, don't bother",1
Too much advertising and buggy - uninstall,1
Boring and gets super laggy and fills with ads,1
Unistalling complete waste of time . This game freezes constantly. And is full of ads . The game also closes even in the middle of a level . DO NOT INSTALL,1
You have to watch an ad after every level. The ad takes as long or longer than the actual game. No fun.,1
very boring game,1
Wow,1
Ads ads Ads too many ads,1
Yikes,1
More ads than game.,1
Far too many adds,1
Lots of ads,1
"Crashed after the tutorial level, deleted immediately. 🙄",1
It's a really stupid game! It just freezes every single time!!!! When you move to left it goes to right when you move to right it moves to left...A complete waste of time...,1
Ad farm,1
The amount of ads is insane,1
"Number of ads in the game is unbelievable, it makes the game unplayable!",1
Way too many ads to get into it. I uninstalled after three levels.,1
Ads for everything.,1
👎👎👎,1
Ads masters,1
Too many in game ads,1
Ads after every game. No thanks.,1
Only ads. No game,1
So many adds,1
Ads ads ads!,1
An ad every single time u beat a level!,1
Don't get it. Wayy to many ads. You click one thing by mistake it will take you to an ad. The ads are longer than 1 round in this game. Terrible,1
An ad between EVERY level. The ads run longer than it takes to get through a level. I deleted after 5 minutes.,1
Ad farm,1
Ads after every 10 second round? Ridiculous. Uninstall after 3 rounds.,1
Too many ads after each round,1
Atleast an ad every minute. Game play is toddler tier.,1
122 megabytes of ads,1
Puro ads parang bobo,1
This game is stupid af,1

"Terrible, nothing but ads",1
"Too much advertisement, after every episode you have to watch ads which is so annoying",1
Way too many ads.,1
Adfest... good idea... but ad after ad after ad after ad... dont download.. unless you like ads.. the fun to ad ratio is wicked skewed... play 1 round watch 3 ads... did I mention there was ads? Well.. there are... a plethora of them in fact.. with this many ads the game should be the best game ever.. its not.,1
Contain lots of add's.. Doesn't have interest to play game.. Worst experience,1
"Game is okay, ads are atrocious. Greedy developers push too hard to purchase to remove ads. If I could give a 0 star rating I would. Mobile games are a joke, especially this one. Avoid at all costs, not worth it.",1
Kk,1
Too many ads,1
Ads after every round,1
It is taking long to download and my wifi is fi😞😞😭,1
"Thought it would be a nice way to 'shut down' but the ads make it impossible to. Anytime I tried to close them, it would try and get me to install whatever it was about.",1
I am don't like this game,1
"There's more ad time than actual gameplay and the gameplay itself is mind-numbingly repetitive. Overall, it's a really poorly-designed game.",1
"way too many ads, I get that these guys need to make money, but damn",1
Too many ads,1
NOT FUN,1
Datt sale itni bekar game sale har ek level ke baad sale advertisement de dete h bakk,1
"Actualy Zero Stars. This game is more adds than game itself. I like the idea they have and it could be fun and challenging if it wasnt for the over exesive adds. O the game freezes constantly, i even cleaned my phone up... It stil freezes.",1
I actually hate this game it isnt like the photos so if you want to put your net in trash you can download it 🤮,1
Too much ads,1
ADDDDDDSSSSSSSS ONLYYYYYYY,1
Nice app I love it boot it's izi,1
Needs longer levels but its the 30 second ads that ruins it.,1
Really... an ad after literally every level... bit much. Uninstalled it,1
Didnt care for this game to easy,1
Too many ads and ads are too long. Waste of time,1
Advertisement after every single game play. Which is about every 10 to 20 seconds,1
"Actual garbage after high levels phone sometimes chooses where it wants to go, luck game and not skill based.",1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads!,1
"Absolutely garbage. Every round, there's an ad. Ads, ads, ADS. To make things worse those ads take 10 seconds minimum to skip. Just a joke of a game.",1
Looked interesting but adverts after every level. When the levels were only 30 second just made it unbearable. Only played 4levels.,1
مزخرف,1
You'll spend far more time watching ads than you will actually play anything here. Save yourself the trouble and don't even start.,1
"Oh look, yet ANOTHER game where the ads take longer than the level completion! Might be a good game otherwise, DELETED and wont be downliading again until they sort out the ads",1
Three .minutes of game 4 minutes of ad,1
So many ads it's unbearable,1
"Low quality, unoriginal, terrible.",1
In theory there is a game buried somewhere under all those ads. More time spent watching ads than game play.,1
Too many ads!,1
adds ads adds ads adds ads adds ads so sad the ads,1
"Great concept however the amount of ads is obscene! Can't touch the screen once before getting an add. You pass a level ad, collect coins ad, build ad, attack ad. Exist ad",1
Guy,1
Noob,1
"Zero stars, you can't even get into enjoying the game because it's just add smear, everything you do it's an add. Removing from my phone",1
VENKATSH,1
There's an ad after every level you complete or fail,1
Can't do anything without an ad at every turn you make..,1
Constant ads! 30 second ad after every round.,1
"Super boring, deinstalled it. Also way too many ads.",1
Boring,1
Way too many ads. 10 second round with a 15 -30 second ad following it everytime. It is also too easy of a game.,1
Thanks again,1
Wayyyyyy too much ads sorry i do not recommend.,1
Ridiculous ammount of ads. Ypu spend more time watching them than playing the game.,1
"Ads, ads, ads...",1
"No challenge, ads take more time than actual game, would not recommend.",1
"Way too many ads. Game would be fun, but I'm on ads more than actually playing the game lol.",1
"This is an advertising platform not a game. You have ads at every min, ads after every run and ads for every purchase, the worst is that the game is not even good. Ridiculous in it's greediness. But if it's your cup of tea you do you.",1
There is more ads than gameplay. Can't even play 10seconds straight without an ad.,1
Too many adds.,1
Fun game but way too many ads.,1
"As others have said, this is more like an ad watching app with a mini-game in the background. The game is easy, so you finish quick so that you can watch more ads.",1
just too many many ads,1
Gets boring to fast,1
it brock,1
Way to many adds,1
"Totally hell 😡😡 though the game is simple but the ads after every level sucks😑😑 two ads of other games after every single level. Level end in less than 1 minute but the ads consume more time than game's level. Total wate of time. If u wanna see lots of ads and a little bit game, then install this.",1
Ad simulator,1
Tati,1
To many ads cant enjoy the game,1
Absolutely hate it and not what it said it is,1
I swear there's no good games nowadays all of them have ads every second,1
Too many ads. Absolute stupid.,1
Very not halal hamood,1
"Interesting premise. Except there's an advertisement at the bottom of your screen at all times, and an ad at every single game you play, and an ad to get more coins, and an ad to get more bonuses. This game would be better if they just removed the game and left the ads",1
Has more ads than gameplay,1
Too many adverts. Should be able to turn them off,1
"Nice idea for a game, but it's way too easy . . .",1
"Terrible. Am ad after every play. After only playing a few levels, I immediately uninstalled this game.",1
Way too many adds.,1
Wow,1
"So many ads, it's beyond ridiculous.",1
Very very addie and dirty game,1
Add is irritating,1
"Constantly crashes, unplayable.",1
Adverts after you do anything,1
Ad after every level. Takes 30 seconds to get thru a level. You're seriously watching ads more than you're playing the game.,1
Why only ads,1
The ads are way overboard. It makes you watch a 30 second add after 15 seconds of play. This game was made to make money off people watching adds it very low budget,1
I can't go one game without the ads interrupting. Please fix your game.,1
"You're presented with a choice for a reward. It's not random, they force you to watch two ads to unlock the real reward every time. I'll always rate dishonest tactics poorly.",1
BAD,1
"Gets repetitive after 5 mins and theres an ad per match, and the matches are 30 seconds, what a cashgrab of a game",1
Garbage. unplayable due to ads. total garbage.,1
"In order to play this game, the developers require that you give them access to the following: real name, postal code, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, or other similar identifiers.Physical location or movements. Internet or other similar network activity Information on your interaction with application, or advertisement. Records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consumin",1
there is a game in my ads,1
About 80% advert 10% fluff 10% game if you want to have some fun AVOID this one.,1
Too many ads,1
Waaaay too many ads. 70% ad time 30% play,1
Entertaining for a while but the non stop advertising kills it and makes you feel like you spend more time watching an ad then playing the game. Wouldn't recommend,1
항상 손,1
"Looking for an app which forced you to watch unlimited ads and waste your bandwidth, then you're in the right place. Please install to watch ads.",1
Adverts,1
The ads is overkill. Theres an ad after every play sometimes two ads. Then each ad you have to press the x three times. It's way to much. I'm uninstalling.,1
If you didn't have 2 ads every single level maybe I'd enjoy the game... A joke.,1
There are more ads than play time,1
"Gameplay is clunky and the runners would randomly put on a burst of speed and miss bridges(gates, triggers) regardless of how slowly I slid my thumb across the screen After I played the first 55 or 60 levels, my phone overheated. The only time that's ever happened before with this phone is with certain VR videos. Other reviews mention the ads and they're not exaggerating--it's an adfarm. I'll be deleting this game as soon as this review is done. It's a shame--I wanted to like the game.",1
By the third round I already failed? And saw too many ads! Uninstalled,1
Not a game. Just adds,1
"Love the concept, hate the execution. Come on! An ad every level, seriously? A lot of greed, and not enough investment in the interface.",1
Ads! You just waste your time by playing the game! No purchase option!,1
The game is alright but the amount of ads makes it unbearable,1
Ads ads and more ads after each level.,1
Too many ads,1
Seems like the started out with the intention to just house ads. Poorly designed and no real objective.,1
One full screen add every minute!!!,1
Ads ads ads ads ads ads ads,1
AD'S AFTER EVERY SINGLE LEVEL!!! ALWAYS SAME ADVERT! SO ANNOYING,1
Unbelievable amout of ads smh,1
Doesn't know how to times numbers thinks 43x100 equals 143?!,1
Too many ads. Shame as the gameplay is nice.,1
"Wow, this is awful. Honestly, the core game is kinda fun, but there is one required add EVERY LEVEL. Plus additional adds every level for bonuses. You literally watch more ads than play the game.",1
"Way too many ads, geezy!",1
I really hate the ads in this game because it distracts me to focus on the game,1
Trashh,1
Good game,1
Bbbbboring,1
Boring,1
ADS! After every single level and even ad banners during the levels.,1
Ad ridden and hardly worth waiting through the ads to play a level for 10 seconds. Instant uninstall after about 5 minutes.,1
💩💩💩💩🤮🤮,1
If you wanna play a game where you have to watch an ad after every single level then look nowhere else cause this is the game for you!!,1
"If I could give it less than a star I would , the adverts on this game makes its completely unplayable. Not worth the data",1
"It's a nice game, fun. And then there are ads. So many ads. SO MANY. Every ten to twenty seconds. I'm shocked there weren't any ads mid game, I think it's a wasted time potential. You could put more ads mid levels. Because at the end of level, there's an ad, and after there's another ad. I played for ten minutes, in which I was forced to watch at least six minutes of ads. Do not download. Unless you want to watch ads.",1
All I can say is release the kraken on ads. This is fully bloated adware,1
Bad,1
lots off ads and advertising videos sucks,1
Might be an ok game if you could actually play without all the ads. Spend more time on ads than you do the game.,1
Add both are,1
"Literally a 30 second ad after every level. It's an ad generator, not a game",1
Advert after every level... bye!!,1
The worst game ever,1
"HOLY! AD CENTRAL!! The game itself is super easy, although I only made it to level 3 before I installed due to adds. For everyone 15 second level, there is a 30 second ad. Not a fun experience at all.",1
This is very nob I thing this game make on children,1
Can I remove ads by purchasing? The ads are absolutely ridiculous.,1
Very bad game,1
Too many ads,1
More ad time than game time,1
Ads everywhere Just a money making scheme I'm not even going to try to be nice,1
To much ads I hate it,1
"Full of ads, and not worth olaying because of them Play a level Ad Do something Ad Ad Ad Not fun dont bother",1
Didn't work properly Got stuck on a few screens,1
Ad after every level. Not much fun at all,1
"The only control is Left or Right- so why so glitchy? And how do you justify an advert at the end of the level, that lasts longer than the level you complete?",1
Utter rubbish. Ypu spend more time looking at adds than playing,1
"Rubbish, adds after adss",1
It's stupid an add after every level,1
"Jeffrey,,07",1
Did one level and immediatwly got a long ad. No thanks.,1
Too many Ads.,1
Too many ads,1
to many ads,1
There is an AD between every level.,1
App will not load. A complete waste of time. Do not bother with this company or its apps just a waste of time.,1
Pretty boring 😴,1
There is more time spent watching commercials than playing games. Preposterous!!!​,1
Sachin jaat,1
Its good gamebut their is too much adds but you can paly it offline if you want,1
هذة اللعبة فى غاية السوء,1
𝐷𝑜𝑒𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙,1
Too much of adds for each level 😡,1
one star...too much ads...waste of time downloading...,1
WAY TO MAY ADS. 👎,1
Ridiculous amount of ads,1
"Stupid. Two ads per level, as well as needing to watch two more ""optional"" ads to open chests. Not a game, just a vehicle for ads. You'll spend about three to four times as much time watching ads as playing the ""game"".",1
Ads,1
"Ad after every level, that's not cool!!",1
My tablit sucks i cant play is still downloading,1
Me hania,1
Ad,1
Not doing anything else you need anything else you can get the latest flash and i am waiting to see if I could,1
"This is the worst game that existed in the universe. If you're gonna install this game you should know that this game will be a stain in your life. Just after you open the game you will see that you made a huge mistake. If you're somebody who wants a better world please do NOT download this thing.( By the way, this thing should be called ""thing"" not a game. Because, as a result of deep assessments and considerations, we know that this is not a game.) Spread the word",1
This game is too slow,1
"If you like ads, get this game.",1
My time watching adds then playing. Easily lost interest because of it,1
So so many ads,1
Magandang laro,1
Just ads,1
Game is addictive if it wasn't for the millions of ads. Such a waste of a good game.,1
It was fun for 5 minutes. Then it's incredibly repetitive with no real challenge and ads ever 20 seconds.,1
Out standing,1
Too many adds one can hardly play the game.,1
"Stupid game, too many ads",1
Useless game designed for showing ads.,1
Too many ads. Ads after almost everything you do.,1
"Download this app if you want to stream silly advertisements on your phone. 75% ads, 25% game play",1
Constantly bombarded with misleading ads that bait clicks. Absolutely disgusting,1
A lot of ads. Or can say only ads,1
Ad after every level,1
Lots of add can't play without net 0 star game,1
Not that fun and a lot of ads they make money off of,1
Too many ads,1
Nothing but commercials and glitches,1
Deleted thos game after less than 5 minutes. Its literately nothing but adverts every 15 seconds.,1
Ay ay ay ay,1
Cool game but this company forces an ad after every little level. Stupid. Try to avoid games like this.,1
"5s played, 30s advs. Deleted after second game.....",1
Ads make this tedious beyond belief. Appreciate it needs to have some but when they are longer than the levels it makes it a waste of time.,1
Riddled with adverts. You'll play 10 seconds of the game for 5 seconds of adverts. Adverts after each and every game.,1
Dont download this stupid count master game it gets stuck all the time every 5 seconds and I hate it 🖕👎,1
best gane bro,1
Ad riddled,1
Way too many ads,1
10 sec game play per minute of ads.,1
so many ads,1
Like all of these types of games the amount of ads are really unnecessary. If you need to support your game you can 100% lessen the ads. 😒 The levels are also extremely short and are too easy. You should use the money you got from the tons of ads and make more levels that are longer. It is a fun game but it can definitely be better. Once i saw the first ad after me playing for less than 20 seconds only playing one round i uninstalled.,1
Ads are 3 times longer than the time you spend playing. I get you need to make money guys but that's just pure greed,1
To many adds,1
Each level lastscabout 3 seconds then you get a guaranteed advert after every level that lasts 60 seconds. Uninstalled as it's just an app for pure advertisement.,1
"It's to full of advertising, almost impossible to enjoy the game",1
Stop that ads,1
Too many long ads. Rubbish,1
بازی مسخره چرت,1
çok salak bi oyun 8 bölüm katlanabildim,1
Very bad,1
The ads make this game nearly unplayable,1
1 minute of adverts for every 20 seconds of play.,1
Fusn game but there is literally an ad after every step you do you. Would not recommend. Plenty of other free games with no ads,1
96% adds,1
Very bad game always strucking very very bad game,1
"Imagine a game where each level is about 30 seconds with the most basic mechanic you have ever seen. But you get an add after every level, which again is only 30 seconds. The add after that is also 30 seconds. See the problem here? It's an easy no brainer game That has more adds than television.",1
Stupid game with massive amounts of ads...it's essentially all ads...,1
"You know how everyone was like, just turn off airplane mode and then you'll get less adds. LIES. The developers have made it where you have to get a stable internet connection to play their game, even though there is NO online game play, this means that you can't avoid the adds that are put at the end of every level and every other button press. If I wanted to watch bad adds of would have gotten youtube instead. Developers really just want a passive income not a quality game play experience. 0/5",1
Worst game ever,1
Super game,1
Afwul,1
The ads are unreal. Too much. It can't be fun when you have to wait 30 seconds in between each round and press back 10 times to get away from the virus spam the ads bring.,1
Fun game but way too many long ads to make me want to continue. Played 10 min and deleted the thing. Too bad.,1
"Nothing But Adds Too much adds in this game And I recommend everyone , not to download this game",1
"A solid 2 star game if you're playing it on airplane mode (no ads). I wouldn't call it ""fun"" tbh. The challenge is extremely minimal and doesn't increase notably at any point; I only lost two rounds and that's due to zoning out. The skins are meh and they cost progressively more coins each skin (and they're randomly selected, you don't get to choose). There's no real satisfaction to be had in completing any of the tasks. Just not much to enjoy here, all in all.",1
No thrill only boredom,1
"One level, one ad, one bonus, one ad, one ad, one ad...only sound is in the ads.",1
Love it 😍😍😍,1
k.a Con,1
Terrible game. Ads every 15 sec... Don't chase the money that hard. People want to have fun......,1
Ilovemy👍game,1
Cool 😎 game,1
Too much ads I don't like it every game has ads I don't download really,1
Well.... There is an ad after every run!,1
Too many ads.,1
"Not a bad little game but way too many ads, every level an ad that's why uninstalled!!! Spend more time watching than playing!",1
"U will be watch ad after every singler stage, play 10s and watch ad 5sec, stupid game",1
"There is an ad efter every level, considering it takes you 15 second to finish a level and sd 30 seconds this ap is pretty much an ad spam pretending to be a game, id made me loose intereset immediately, uninstalled 30 minutes after i installed it!",1
You get an ad after every single level. And they are longer than the game play. It's like you're watching a TV show right? And after every line of dialog it goes to commercial. That's what it's like playing this game. Uninstalled after 5 minutes. So like 45 seconds of gameplay,1
90% ads 8% upgrades 2% game,1
"Ads after every level, usually 30 second ones that you can't skip. Shame because the game concept is pretty fun.",1
It's fun but I don't like a stupid lag so I uninstall this game,1
Add as soon as the game loads. Deleted.,1
"I get it's a free game but way to many ads. One after every level, and the ads run longer then the levels themselves.",1
Uninstalled because of ads. Unbearable.,1
"To many ads, glitchy, slow.",1
Really fun but after every round just adds that I cant skip,1
This game is horrible #uninstall,1
I hate the game,1
Constant ads,1
"I got bored of this after 5 minutes and being forced to watch ads, what's the point.",1
Way too many ads.,1
Tik tok,1
"I only played until first ad, and delete, 10 seconds max.",1
Too much ads,1
The bonus feature at the end of each level where you can multiply your diamonds just loads without actually giving you the bonus Poor functionality on android.,1
To much adds i can't even play the game normal,1
Reporting for false advertisement as game is nothing like the video ads depict,1
"Fun for 3 minutes, then incredibly dull and repetitive. Once you've done one level, you've done them all as they're all the same.",1
Hi I'm pjhdhf,1
This game is a waste of time. And the adds are to many...,1
An unskipable add after evey 30 sec round. Do not play this,1
What a sad excuse for a scam,1
"So much potential, like the other reviews said. Just the fact that the ads are after every level and long with no way to skip makes this game unplayable. Installed and Uninstalled in just a few minutes.",1
TOO MANY ADS,1
"The amount of ads is just totally unnecessary 😒 😑. You have to watch an ad after every time you win/lose, and let me say it once more, the gameplay is 99.99999% just ads.",1
"A horribly boring ad factory, creators were trying even less than normal ad factories.",1
Time wasting game with no logics. Too much time is wasted by advertisements,1
Nice game,1
Not worth playing. No challenge and the same repetition,1
Game freeze glitch to much when trying to play.,1
Ads ads ads...,1
Ayushkarmkar,1
Rubbish too much ads you have to watch after every level,1
Boring repeating short levels. Ads after every level.,1
Each board takes a few seconds to finish and there is an ad after EVERY SINGLE BOARD. Another stupid game just wanting to make money on advertising.,1
"too lag,too much ads,not enjoyable,no fun,i hate it",1
I hate adds,1
First advert after ten seconds. Instant uninstall.,1
Ads are too much. Gameplay is extremely repetitive.,1
"Super fun gsme, However, it freezes all the freakin time 😞 most dissatisfying",1
Count.Masters.Croowf...,1
Played the game for 30 seconds and it crashed,1
"As noted by others, literally a quick game then more time watching adverts than playing further. Not worth the hassle",1
Sr,1
I wanted to see how many adds it would actually get I thought they were exaerating but they are not. I could not even play the game I did not even play one round because it took such a long time to load the game. I could not even play the game bc of that. Not cool. I would give it zero stars honestly.,1
Mind numbingly simple. More ads than game. Avoid.,1
The ads they force you to watch are longer than the levels themselves.,1
It's mostly ads,1
This will go perfect on my channel for the stupidest game ever like seriously it's so laggy I can't get over it and also what the heck you keep getting this game same score I keep getting the same score even though I got more people this game is so laggy glitchy I hate this game,1
"10 seconds of gameplay then a 30 second AD after each level, this is nuts too bad the game would have been fun uninstalled",1
Trash,1
Very poor,1
Ads after every level and after everything you click on. Absolutely ridiculous. Uninstalled,1
They hate it whennyou get more than 150 kill off all your units. Also its a moblie gam what do you think.,1
Bleagh! Boring!,1
"Horrible. Each level takes 15 seconds to complete, followed by 2 or 3 ads. No thanks.",1
Talk about building a game around ads. You literally get a full video ad after every level making your fun little 20 second cost you another 30 in ads,1
"Seriously? How to play when there are so many ads? The game is good, but the advertisement convinced me to delete it and I do not advise anyone to spoil their nerves",1
"Ads, ads, ads, if you don't want the booster at the end of a level from watching an ad, well too bad they make you watch an ad anyway, and no booster for u",1
"Fun concept, but screw you if you think I am going to watch a AD after every level.",1
More time spent watching unskippable ads than on actual gameplay.,1
Freaking ads in every level ...so annoying ffs ..0 star for it.,1
Holy cow after every level a 2 min ad. No thanks. Removed from phone.,1
"An ad every 10 seconds, don't bother.",1
Ads after each level last longer than the game itself.,1
After each round you have to watch an ad.,1
Ads that are hard to get away from and take you away from the game to the play store are a no go for me.,1
So many adds I'll rate it 0/10,1
Too many ads,1
game full of ads! not worth your time,1
"Play five seconds, watch ads for five minutes.",1
Add after every level,1
too much ads,1
This is an add with small bits of a game.,1
Constant adds ruin the experience.,1
Too much of ads,1
"Super fun game, but it's borderline unplayable with how many ads there are, you will get a 15 second usually unskippable ad after every single round, which is annoying, but is way worse when you learn that a round is usually like 10-15 seconds, it's terrible, game has a lot of potential, but the ads needs to be reduced, or offer an endless level, so each round isn't only a few seconds",1
Ads longer then actual games play,1
"The game itself isn't too bad, however the ads are just way too frequent. You get ads after every single level. If you don't mind ads every 30 seconds (because that's about how long each stage is) then it's a decent time waster. However for me this amount of ads is inexusable.",1
Too many adds,1
Too many ads,1
One star because of your slimy advertising,1
"So many ads, installed for my son to play. Uninstalled 5 minutes later.",1
Good,1
Ad after every level smh,1
"Way to many ads. Do not download, a complete waste of time.",1
"Way too much ads. And about the game, it is fun at the beginning, but will started to get boring cos of repetition of the same type of levels",1
More ads that actual game time! Don't waste your time downloading,1
Too many ads. 20 seconds of game play then 30 seconds of ads,1
Yikes!!!!!!!! This game and this game developing company should be banned,1
Too many ads. Crashed my phone.,1
Ad after every 30 seconds? No thanks. Trash game for that reason.,1
To many adds...every level adds longer than the level. Deleting,1
To many adverts,1
"You have an ad after every run, and the ad is longer then the run...You Decide if that is worth it.",1
"Troppe pubblicità, qualche secondo di gioco e poi almeno 30secondi di pubblicità ogni livello.",1
Too many ads,1
Ads after every single little run. 5-10 seconds the first like 20-30 levels take and then you get a 15 second ad...you can bypass it by closing the app and then reloading but the game isn't good enough to warranty even that amount of effort...1 star and that's only because I can't give it 0.,1
To many adds,1
Very very nice game and best app very time pass game,1
Wow the same after after every level. Split it up a bit guys maybe let people do a few levels before forcing an ad that can't be skipped. I will never go to a company that uses advertising like this.,1
This game is absolutely garbage. There are more ads than actual gameplay,1
Really bad game. Ads pop up every second. Dont even waste your time on this 💩,1
Adds during gameplay and ads after every single level. Completely ruined a half decent game,1
Every level has adverts. Great game ruined.,1
V bad don't waste you time on this app like me,1
Nice,1
It needs more challenges less ads and more excitement like different maps,1
"Very boring game, doesn't even last 30 seconds and after finishing you get hit with ads, don't install this game.",1
Ads after ads after ads,1
Game concept is good and I realize ads are a necessity to help pay for development but when you get ads at the end of every completed level it becomes very teadius to play and not fun!,1
Ads every 5 seconds,1
Bad game with too much ads,1
Too many ads,1
To many ads.,1
Fun game but when you get to play it between adds. Uninstalled in probably 5 minutes of playing aka watching adds.,1
Couldn't even form an opinion of the game due to the ad overload. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.,1
Ads after every single level??? This game isn't even fun & you throw ads in that often? What a joke! UNINSTALL,1
Way way way too many ads! Game is good...when you can play it!,1
This is so stupid game it take 12 days to install don't install this game guys,1
Too many ads. Ruins the game.,1
baad ads!! popping all the time,1
too many ads,1
"Uninstalled it after 5 mins, too many adverts, every level you have to sit through 30 seconds of adverts.",1
Too many ads what a piece of rubbish,1
Never seen so many ads,1
Games break after I get 300 people fix it,1
It's ads with game not games with ads 😒😒😒,1
An ad after every level is insane,1
"Very easy game, and it's full of adds to the point 70% of your time is watching adds.",1
An add after every level. No thanks.,1
"too much ads, don't download",1
Good game,1
Its just not fun,1
Relatively a fun game but you spend more time watching ads then playing,1
Too many ads just to get new things you have to watch an ad,1
This game is worst after every level 1000 of ad comes please ban this game,1
Clickbait game,1
"Ads are relentless. No real skill required, the game has been designed in a way where it will force your experience to a set result. EG give you 200 units and then force you to lose 150 due to an obstacle which cannot be completely avoided. I bet if you could see everybody's scores for each level they would all be identical.",1
Too many ads,1
Stop savage advertising,1
Game is good but it contains lot of ads which makes uncomfortable while playing and we may lose interest in the game,1
Ad player with a few seconds of gameplay in between,1
"Fun game, but ads run after each level, and are longer than it takes to play the level. Deleted game.",1
to many ads. waste of your time,1
"App is more ads than game. 3 or 4 gates then an ad, most upgrades are an add. New skin or colour ad. Might as well watch the shopping channel instead.",1
Count master has potential but the glitches irritates very much...when you've reached high score the glitch starts and you have to start over,1
"Ads, ads, ads. Way too many, making the game unenjoyable.",1
The game is good but man Ads just ruins the gameplay and overall experience.,1
Worst game too many adds,1
بابيييخ,1
As after ad after ad.,1
"Nasty. Ads ads ads. Can't even play more than 1 round without an advertisement. 10 seconds of play, 30 seconds of adverts. Avoid!",1
Fun game but the twenty to thirty second ads between EVERY level is unbearable.,1
Too many adds,1
Don't bother with this app. The game is not nearly enjoyable enough to justify the excruciating ads.,1
Way too many ads. You have to watch a 30 second ad after every level. I played about 10 levels and immediately uninstalled it.,1
"Pathetic, lagging, slow",1
Too much adds,1
Terrible game. Takes just as much time to complete a level as it takes to watch one of the many ads. Dont waste your time with this game,1
To much adds,1
I haye these games. 5 seconds of game play and 30 seconds of adds. Also the insta add takes you to a toltally different game. It's awesome if you like watching adds. Terrible,1
Adverts adverts ADVERTS!,1
"Every level you complete everything a 30 second unskippable ad will play, it's honestly pathetic and clearly a crash grab, would give it no stars but I dont have that choicd",1
"This game is made to show you a lot of ads and it does implement it well, but the main problem is the game as absolutely no objective to complete at all. Levels are automatically generated as you go so a scaling dificulty is inexistant (fail a level and try again, the layout will be completely different). Diamonds are used in the ""Build"" mode to be able to farm more diamonds, but completing the mode has no reward at all. If you really want to see the gameplay just disable internet for this app.",1
Terrible. Seriously don't need to have a damn ad after EVERY SINGLE GAME!,1
Just another ad grinder.,1
Unplayable due to adverts,1
"Like already someone wrote - ""Enjoyable game but completely ruined by the frequency of the adverts."" You spent more time watching ads then playing the game.",1
Too many ads,1
Ads every 20 seconds. More ads than game time. 👎,1
I HATE IT,1
Too many ads too many !!!!,1
"When there's actual gameplay it's okay, but ads were excessive. Short level, ad. Collect reward, ad. Upgrade, ad. Build, ad. Watch an ad, get another ad.",1
Throwaway game,1
Very dad app this app only for adds don't wast your time don't install who created this app haa 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤦,1
Needs work,1
"Ads ads and ads, nothing more....",1
I did not enjoy this game because you just choose the higher number and you are able to win,1
' Vishnu,1
Game was fun until you realize the ads last longer then the game play and the game doesn't progress once you take over the map. Waste of time,1
This game suck ever single time there is ads.,1
Ads after every level and to unlock or use basically anything. More ad than gameplay. So much lag it becomes unplayable.,1
Omg the ads.....,1
After every f ucking game alot of shity ads .. go to he ll,1
Every 10 seconds of gameplay is met with an unskippable 30 second advert. Not worth it.,1
"This could have been a good game, but it is just an ad player.",1
Every second ads ads ads thats why i am going to uninstall this.,1
More adverts than gameplay The adverts try to force you into downloads. Could have been a good game but deleting,1
Too manyyyyy ads! Unbelievable,1
You get to play the ACTUAL game for about 10 seconds. Then you have to watch 45 seconds to a minute of add. Don't waste your time.,1
There's an ad after every level,1
Way to many add,1
Bekaaar ekdum,1
Comercial after every leve os super anoying...,1
Way among us? Way way?,1
Bad ad,1
YOU GET AN AD AFTER EVERY SYAGE. SAY EVERY 10-15 SECONDS How many bloody ads you want. You really have stuffed up a decent game with bloody greed. Mongers like you should not be allowed to put so many ads in. There needs to be some sort of monitoring of in game ads. Like 1 every couple of minutes or 1 every 25 plus stages with a game like this. YOU LIT ARE THE REASON WHY THESE GAME ONLY STAY ON PEOPLES PHONES FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE. You need to be reported,1
"Wow Ads! The game would be ok, but there are ads between each level. The ads are longer than the levels...",1
Waste worst bad....,1
"If you want a game with 0 sound and 30 second advertisements after a 5 second level with 0 difficulty, this game is for you. This is a money grab for the developers",1
This is not a game. It's an app for showing ads.,1
"Ads, ads and ads",1
Unplayable. Constant interruptions for ads mid play. Most games at least wait until a natural stopping point,1
I honestly wouldn't recommend this game because once you start getting to the higher levels there are traps where you have to lose troops and there's nothing you can do to avoid them.,1
My first review was not accurate after a hour or so the adds are many double adds. Some adds extremly long before the deleate icon appears a Will be deleating this game.,1
Way to many adds,1
Don't download if u hate ads... tests your patience with ads..👎👎👎,1
"After playing for 10 minutes I uninstalled it as the was no game play, only adverts. Only install if you are interested in watching ads.",1
"Terrible, don't bother downloading. The game itself is ok (not great or good, just ok) but the levels are so short that you spend more time watching ads than playing. I kept waiting for the levels to get decently long but nope. It's just an ad machine.",1
"Was OK, then you build everything on the island, unlock all the rubbish skins and there's no way to expand further. Too many ads, too little content, perhaps some more thought into expanding the game play next time.",1
"Calculations are all wrong 😐😑 According to you, 10×5=48 seriously? And 48×2=80???",1
"I Just downloaded this app and I already hate it for how much it lags. Then I turn back on my wifi and it's just ads and more ads and more ADS this game sucks, I hope you delete it soon and never make another game again.",1
Way too many ads. One after each match. Absolutely ridiculous.,1
30 second ad after every 5 second game..... Pass.,1
Holy ads,1
More ads than gameplay!!,1
Faiyt,1
Too many ads. An ad after every single level.,1
Add after add after add 0 stars,1
Too simple. Ungodly amount of ads,1
the obstacles and ads make no sense in this game,1
Played for 10 mins until ads every 15sec was more than I could deal with. Not recommended as more time spent watching ads than playing the actual game.,1
Okay game. Simple and relatively brain dead 1star for forced ads between EVERY round. Annoying and full length.,1
Too much publicity,1
3 sec of play for 3 minute ad,1
Bawkas game ha bilkul,1
This could be a fun game. I couldn't tell because there was a commercial after level. I understand that you have to make money but I should not have to spend 40 seconds watching commercials for every 10 seconds playing the game. This was a waste Of time.,1
Too much ads. Even after every level there is a advertisement.,1
TOO MANY ADS. Even in the middle of you playing,1
Terrible experience. First game in 45 second ad. 2 game in another 30 second ad. So I deleted it immediately. If all you want to do is sell ad space maybe you shouldn't be developing games. What an absolute waste of space.,1
Too many ads,1
Toooooooooooo many ads.,1
Bad quality,1
"Every time I complete a level I have to watch an advert. I've worst part is, when trying to click off the ad, i usually get sent to the game store. I spend more of the game watching ads and trying to not accidentally click into the game store. Would not recommend",1
"If you want a better game than this, pick one at random, and you'll almost definitely have one.",1
The amount of ads is ridiculous. How about banner ads? Uninstall after playing an hour because of ads.,1
Boring horrible game .,1
Too many ads!!!! This is a great game and is fun to play but the ads are ridiculous. I'll be uninstalling,1
Bad game,1
THEY HAVE ADDS AFTER EVERY LEVEL,1
To many adsss frfr,1
Trash You play 30 sec and you get 5 min of commercials,1
Its amezing,1
Ads ads ads,1
Tatti,1
The game is dumb and to many ads and it lags out so its trash to be honest if there was a 0 star rating that is what it deserves,1
All abt advertizing 😤😤,1
Could be better game if traps were more avoidable or non existent and you instead had panels with dividing and substraction. Skins just aim at popular games and are uncreative. Levels are too repetitive and it's cheaply made to just get to the top games and then drop down.,1
Games fun too much add had to delete it,1
Ad after every level unless you pay. It isn't worth it unless you pay.,1
Adds simulator. Not much of gameplay...,1
Disgusting. Spent more than half of time by just watching ads! You play 10 seconds to watch 15-sec ads. Horrible 🤮,1
Stupid ads,1
too meny addvert,1
it crashes at end every round,1
Too many Ad's,1
Way too many ads. Game gets stuck on about the third level. Stupid concept. Unclear what the point is unless you know nothing about math and don't think that x100 is not more than x2.,1
There's a lot of ads.,1
Too much ads. Worthless,1
Plagued with ads. And not any ads. Sexually explicit ads that are not for children.,1
Too many adds,1
Ads..,1
Adverts adverts adverts UNINSTALLED! AS A GAMER I CAME ACROSS THIS APP IN A ADVERT SO I DONWLOADED IT I NEVER DOWNLOAD FAKE ADD GAMES THANKFULLY IT WASNT A FAKE ADD INSTEAD IT WAS BARE ADVERTS. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS UNLESS YOU LOVE WATCHING ADVERTS. TO THE DEVELPER WHEN U PUT IN A PAID BIT OF CONTENT THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT OF NO ADS RELPY TILL THEN EVEYONE WITH BRAIN CELLS WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD THIS. SORT IT OUT MUSH AND YOU MAKE MORE MONEY 💰💸 YOU GOY A FANTASTIC GAME AND ITS A HUGE SHAME!! 😭🙄😬,1
Too much adds,1
Multiple adverts after every level. Very disappointing experience,1
"Ads, ads and oh so many more ads.....",1
To many adds,1
This game has far too many ads it's like you play one round of the game and 1 to 100 ads come on it really just annoys me and I hate when games do that 😤😶🙄😒😡👎😣😴,1
Unplayable. Too many ads. Levels are too short. Just a cash grab by the developer.,1
"This game is pure boredom. You can never get more people thank basucally 200 and it is completely luck based. They hope that bright colors and among us skins will keep you entertained and addicted, but it is actually really bad. There's no point in even downloading it. Just a waste of time.",1
Ads,1
TOO MANY ADS!!!!!,1
"I didn't expect much as it was a game from one of those reputive intrusive ads, but it's only fun for 1-2 rounds. Not enough variety in gameplay to keep interest and there's an ad after every round.",1
Utter shite! Ads and more ads,1
this is a very bad game,1
Just way too many ads! Only lasted ten minutes good game otherwise,1
i hate this game first so many ads second laggy third the ads are lying about this game seriously dont download it 1 star,1
Way too many ads. 0 integrity from this developer.,1
To many adverts. Evey move you take has an advert inbetween. Rubbish.,1
Too much add in every single lvl,1
कस्यां 😘☺,1
Fun game but full length adds after every turn.,1
"This game blacked out/froze bad enough I had to restart my phone, twice. Also it has a ton of ads. I couldn't delete this faster.",1
low effort,1
To laggy to even play devs please fixs,1
Boring as hell how is this number 1,1
"The game is fun but the ads kill it. When the time watching ads is longer than the play time, something is really wrong.",1
So many ads,1
Too many ad's just removed within few levels played,1
Lagging and every level so short with add which always continue 👎,1
Ad every 5 seconds,1
"Nonstop ads and the game will randomly stop responding to input while every game element keeps going, causing you to lose. Very bad.",1
Too many ads even when you don't want the rewards gives an add after every single level do not download 1 star game,1
To many adds a waste of time,1
Very bad game,1
"Forcing people to download adds when closing a game add and you push the X to exit out of the add but it continually takes you to the Google play store to download that game from the add, 1 star horrible!!!!!!",1
full time only ads...,1
Ads make it unplayable,1
Ads ads ads,1
"Once you accept their policies you give up your emails, website history contacts info......and more",1
Too many adverts between each round,1
My phone keeps on freezing when im playing it,1
"I would give 0 stars if I could. Multiple ads after every level, and they last LONGER than the actual gameplay, this is absolutely ridiculous.",1
Ads after every single level. Spent more time trying to skip ads than playing,1
Worst game ever!,1
To slow. Stuck and hang,1
Good,1
Dont play this game... trust me,1
Non-stop ads. Don't bother installing this.,1
Trash,1
Watch more ads then actually play the game,1
Literally too many ads.,1
Played the first level and an ad popped up after I'd finished. I see whete this was going. Uninstalled straight away. Thanks,1
There is an ad after every single level. The ads take longer than the game you play. Uninstalled.,1
So Many add why,1
Great game but ruined by ads after every round. Would be good to see an option to pay to remove the adverts.,1
Not worth it and too much adds,1
Advertisements with a sprinkle of a game mixed in...,1
TERRIBLE GAME. ADS EVERY ROUND,1
That's more than enough for you. Give us a whole minute of playing without ads plzzzss. This is so irritating 😒 🙄 😑,1
Trash. Short levels and a million ads.,1
Too many unskippable ads,1
Just loaded it on to my phone played for 10 minutes now screen gone blank.,1
Progression doesnt mean anything. Levels arent a challenge and dont get any harder. Rewards are literally pointless. Get gems to build something to get more gems and then theres absolutely nothing to spend gems on.. at all.,1
All adds with game in-between,1
Jest to many adds,1
Adds after everything you do. Not worth playing.,1
30 sec add after every 15 sec level. Nope.,1
"Garbage app, shows an ad every five seconds.",1
Mindless Fun but bombardment of ads. Each level is extremely short (maybe a minute long) and between each one you're watching a 30 second advert,1
To much ads ufff unistall time waste,1
Too many long ads and can't be skipped.,1
Chi thu,1
It's not a game..its a advertisement factory 🤯,1
No support. Nothing to do once the US map is completed,1
Don't download this game if you want to pass time it's really boring with a ton of ads,1
Too many ads. It ruins the whole game. You watch more ads then actual play time,1
There is no way to beat the first level designed for everyone to loose.,1
"This is just an ad machine. Ads after every level. And on top of it, it's fairly boring. Its not unfun, but it's definitely not challenging!",1
Filled with ads after every level,1
"Too many ads, especially after each level. Can't stand the constant ads.",1
"Don't download this Count Master game,it's full of ads and it's freezing my device, the battery consumption is very High I had to buy a new phone, it load ads even when you're not playing it, the ads show up in background, just don't download it. 😡",1
RI,1
"Garbage game, ad every single 10 seconds. Hope creator hangs himself.",1
"Deleting due to excessive ads (an ad after every round). I would be willing to pay to be ad-free, but not an option yet.",1
Decent game. Phenominal ad watching simulator.,1
"Every 1 minute disgusting adds, so deleting this app.",1
It is a very bad game so much ads no installing please very very bad game Chi,1
Tem mais ad doq estrelas no ceu,1
"I had to uninstall because of countless of ads and you can't really go back unless you exit out the app. I like the game, but its not worth keeping due to many ads-zero star",1
Controls suck,1
"I understand that Advertising is your money, but every monitor type and it's starting to show me it. Too much guys, too much",1
"Same repetitive levels, too easy.",1
Ads after every single level,1
It sucks,1
"Too laggy, unplayable...",1
"Add after every round, hard to move your crownd to avoid obstacles. The main point is to collect percent and get new skins but even if you collect 100% you still have to watch an add to get it",1
"this is the worst game ive ever played in my life, everytime I want to play, it shows up hundreds of ads and it crashed my computer due to the lagging, pls reduce the lag and make the ads just a bit",1
"If you love ads, you'd love this game 🤮🤮",1
Ridiculously frequent adverts,1
The most stupid game ever,1
Waaaaay too many ads,1
30 seconds of adds for every 10 seconds of game....,1
this game is very nice when i am bor i just paly this game my mind was nice feel,1
Too many ads,1
Bad and very boring🤧😥,1
Riddled with unskippable ads,1
Might be fun if there wasn't an unskippable 30 second commercial after everything. I'd guess you spend at least as much time watching commercials as playing this game. Absolutely ridiculous.,1
You should be able to play as red.,1
Too many Ads. Annoying!!,1
Too much of ads .....can't play the game,1
Ad's after each level. Uninstalled,1
Too many ads Even if you skip,1
Noob,1
Sampah,1
Bad disgusting it moves by it self,1
Too many ads... not worth it,1
So many ads... Unplayable.,1
More time on the ads than the game. Nice little fun game ruined by the fact that after every game you have to watch an advert that asks you 2-3 times whether you want to download it. You sometimes spend more time watching an advert than you do on the game. Uninstalling for that reason. Sorry not sorry.,1
Stop the Ads,1
Nice,1
More adds than game. Uninstalled.,1
Litteraly watch adds more then you get to play the game,1
15 seconds to run a level - 42 seconds of mandatory ad. smh,1
Another game of Advert simulator. Where you play adverts more then a game,1
To many ads,1
"Too many ads. More time watching than playing. Gameplay is good, however it makes my phone heat up a lot. The battery usage is insane! This is on a new Google pixel 6 pro.",1
"Really bad, easy and full of long ads",1
I Know U Need Ads To Earn Bro But So Many Ads After Every Level 30Sec Ad.. Uninstalled It,1
"There is the problem that once you reach more than 200 of the little men, the game lags badly and freezes a few times. Other people I introduced this game to are having the same problem",1
This is very worat app.... Games less than more advertising this app.....,1
Too much lag.,1
absolute dog💩,1
Controls suck to many adds don't waste your time on this pos,1
Too many ads on ads on ads. Waste of time. I spend more time watching ads then I get to play.,1
Just an add after every single 10 second level,1
Cannot turn of ads,1
i was wrong. after 209 it hangß. worst gàme of all time!!!!,1
This game tried to force install apps on my phone I kept hitting cancel (after I never hit begin in the first place) but it wouldn't work until I uninstalled the app.,1
SO. MANY. ADDS.,1
"It's alright. It's just really laggy when you're playing the levels. Games like these shouldn't require a 1000 dollar gaming PC to run. Ads are also annoyingly frequent. You get an ad after almost every level. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a game, until they fix the lag.",1
Way too many ads.,1
Forced downloads. Do NOT play this game!! Can't go from one level to the next with out some kind of ad / forced download. Had to delete MULTIPLE unwanted apps.,1
nah,1
Too much adds disgusting game,1
More ads than gameplay,1
So many ads can't enjoythe game,1
Adds....,1
"It,s is boring",1
Too many adds,1
I want a good time to get the,1
"Each game lasts 10 seconds, the advert lasts 20 to 30 seconds. There is an advert after each game. You spend up to 75% of your time watching an advert rather than playing the game. I played less than 2 minutes of actual game time before getting utterly sick of the nearly continuous adverts. An interesting little game utterly ruined by advertising.",1
its boring and not fun,1
"Ad farm game, banner ads, ads after each level, boring gameplay, don't bother with an install.",1
"NOT fun to play with SO many ads shoved down your throat!! Feels like I'm assaulted every single level end!! That's the OPPOSITE of how it should be!! It's like I'm PUNISHED for completing EVERY SINGLE LEVEL!!!! How about some rewards for ads we can CHOOSE to watch?! Otherwise, it would be a cute game that helps hone your math skills. I JUST NOW installed, got to level 12, & am so angry and annoyed I'm just uninstalling!!! NO ONE likes being forced into anything against their will!!! Logic ppl!!",1
"I really hate this game. I download this and try it firstly this game is very good but after 12th level my phone was hannging on i uninstall this and then there is no problem in my phone. So i want to say that please don't download this game. Very bad game ,very very bad game , very very very bad game 😏😏🙄🙄",1
😡😡😠😡😠😠😠😇😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠BABI😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠,1
Fat belly I was eating from my septic tank when all of a sudden the guy from amon us broke into my house were in a fortniye costume,1
Just too many ads,1
Too much ads!,1
Ads galore,1
Unbalanced ads. For every 10 seconds game play you have 30 seconds of ads.,1
There's an advertisement after every round. Played three rounds and couldn't do it anymore.,1
"Too many ads, there is an ad every other level. If you wanna play Spotify while playing it messes it up. Some obstacles can't be avoided even if you go all the way to the opposite of it. Half the time you can't get the max multiplier even if you get all the troops you can.",1
Boring and repetitive. No fun rewards. Every action requires you to watch an add.,1
Too many ads,1
All ads and no play makes Jack an irritated boy,1
This game have alot of ad this game is boring in every 10 minutes there is a ad if you give it five out of five stars I say you're giving it Rong so I give it one,1
"This isn't a game that come with ads, it's ads that come with a game. The concept is interesting but is made unplayable by constant intrusive advertising. It should be an endless running game, instead each ""level"" very short, only 20 seconds long, and is followed by an ad. You even need to watch an add to recieve content you ""unlock"". Avoid.",1
it's just trash,1
Too many adds. Only enjoyable on airplane mode. Decent concept but game mechanics prevent you from getting higher scores. Levels change but don't really get more difficult.,1
Nothing but adverts,1
Boring game,1
The amount of ads you have to go through to do ANYTHING is ludicrous,1
As other reviews app overwhelmed with ads,1
Hahal na Kita,1
"Levels are short and hella ADs, no thanks!",1
It's really fun but the ads don't let you play cause when it pops it pops non-stop,1
Game is just filled with ads And glitches,1
Dont do it. 30 sec of play followed by 90 seconds of adverts. Spoils it completely,1
The game good but for every 2 minutes of play there is an add every time that lasts about a minute or a minute and a half.,1
"The game starts looking like it may hold promise for gameplay, but becomes incredibly repetitive. This just makes the amount of ads seem even worse than it already is (and it is really bad for ads). If you enjoy the idea of someone making a living as an mini electronic billboard supplier, this is for you. If you enjoy a simple game to pass a little time, forget it.",1
Full of ads. After every 15s game you have to watch 10s of ads. Pretty disgusting for me.,1
Too many ads,1
Ekdom baje kow install karo na,1
May be made for advertising only,1
Would be nice if u didn't get 1 minute ads and 10 seconds play,1
"I played this game because those player who played in your ads sucks, I'll play this game and show them how it is done you morons.",1
30 sec ads for a 15 sec level... Great advertising got me to download this game. Never again... Hopefully.,1
"Like, but way to many ads.",1
Free to play for slaves .,1
"Complete garbage, too many ads.",1
"Ad Fiesta with very mediocre,lackluster gameplay.",1
LOL The game's a joke XD First of all yes ads but that's not the worst thing The worst thing is that you don't even get the gold you gain after you complete a level For example I get 200 after I complete a level but at the end the total amount I get is about 50-ish which ain't even half I was thinking maybe the ads aren't an issue since most games like these have them but c'mon devs couldn't you do better? Cutting off even the gold we get? Now that's a scam Definitely a 1 star!,1
Ruined by the amount of ads,1
"More app than game. Turning off Internet solves it but the game is barely there. Very little strategy, impossible to avoid traps so you just accept the loss. No reason to not go for biggest number every time, a little too simple. Levels are way too short especially for the ads. 1 star for the random amogus.",1
Too much ads,1
"More adds than actual play time. After each round there is about 3 ads, to go a level app you have to watch 3 apps. Ads started in 5 seconds from playing worst app ever",1
Click bait,1
Ads are very few at first. Then an ad is forced on you every level. Do not recommend this trash game.,1
Too much advertisement.,1
It's an ad not a game,1
so many many many many many addddsssss,1
Too many ads,1
"Way too many ads. After each level there is a advertisement, and each level only takes about 30 seconds. It's just unbearable. Don't even bother.",1
boring,1
I played two levels and uninstalled straight away. It came up with forced adds after both levels. And everytime i tapped the exit button on the second add it kept taking me to install it and woild not go back to the game.,1
"Zero stars,so many adds,it makes the game unplayable",1
"Game is full of ads, one ad after each level. Don't waste your time, you'll spend more time watching adverts than actual time playing the game.",1
Too many ads,1
Ad fest,1
So many ads. Game is simple and not fun,1
The ads make the game unplayable.,1
Ads with a bit of game between. Honestly would give it negative rating if I could.,1
😀😀😀😀😀,1
Ads the game,1
Ad trap,1
"1 star. You spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game. The rounds last 10-15 seconds, the ads 15.. SWIFT uninstall",1
30 second ads for 10 seconds of game play,1
"The game itself is fine, but the fact you get long drawn out ads after every short level utterly ruins it.",1
"Boring , time wasting.....",1
Need option to remove ads.,1
"Ads make it unplayable. Which sucks because it could be fun, even with a 99 cent add free version.",1
Too many ads to be able to enjoy it. Uninstalled.,1
Seduction,1
Too many ads,1

مزخرف,1
Way to many ads... Uninstalled like after 5 minutes,1
"Too many ads, sexualized too.",1
"One round takes 5-10 seconds, ads in between take a minute or two. Uninstalled.",1
Not even worth downloading.,1
So many ads and nothing change.,1
Worst👎,1
"The ads are longer than the play, too much lagging",1
Hard control. Ads 30.secs every round.,1
Ads spammer.... Don't bother to download,1
Waste of time game,1
Too many ads. Uninstalled,1
Way too many ads. You spend more time waiting through ads to enjoy the game. Uninstalling!,1
Ads make it unplayable,1
Too many ads,1
Keeps glitching,1
"Had potential. But how well you play does't matter since it constantly uses mechanics that only allows a certain amount of pawns to survive. So how well you play is pointless. You'll end up with x amount of pawns anyway. Scoring system is completely redundant, all you can unlock is cosmetics but to unlock them you have to watch an add anyway. So what point is there to the scoring. Needs new mechanics in order to be bale to properly dodge like jumping, sprinting etc. Waste of time atm",1
Spent more time watching ads than I did playing once I hit level 15. Gives you the option to watch an ad to get bonuses but then forces you to watch an ad even if you click next level.,1
Bad game 🎮,1
Spent more time watching ads than actually playing the game. Don't bother downloading,1
Ads suck after every level.,1
Lag,1
"More ads than game time, what garbage",1
Sajan Chaudhary,1
worst game... ads are continuously coming,1
Every time I played an ad and the game runs slower than a turtle,1
Nothing but ads,1
It was a good came other than ads every game you play. This is one reason why I don't play phone games. Is because of the constant ads and no I'm not paying for a ad free game.,1
Banyak iklannya,1
Stop with all the adds !,1
"Ads, ads, ads, nothing more. Literally you can't do anything in this game, but watching ads",1
Way too many ads,1
Too many ads,1

Total time lost,1
"Too much ads makes it boring and useless, games are mean to entertainment so please avoid adding ads.",1
"Too many ads that can't even be muted if I have to sit through them. I will happily pay for a quality game, but this is just an ad cart.",1
Boring game,1
Ads Game,1
Good,1
Laggy and jumpy gameplay.5 seconds of playing and then 30 seconds of advertising. Total junk. Waste of time.,1
Its awesome of them to let us play a 30s level after 2 minutes of ads and even kinder to not allow for any progression unless you watch another 2 minute ad(but it's free!) Wish i could give it 0,1
"100% awful don't try it. Treat this as a game based on seeing how many back to back ads you can watch in a row before losing interest. And you will not be disappointed. If you go into it expecting any content. There isn't any. The ""game"" (which is less than 20% of your time between ads) is frozen 90% of the time. loading all the ads. The only thing interesting, is wondering how such a low quality game can crash your phone.",1
ITS SO FUN AT YOU VERY SUCH A FUN,1
This game is absolutely disgusting I only have a good review because a thought everyone was mean but know I know what t You guys mean its trash trasher then the developers for head,1
Just another app that scans your phone for targeted advertising,1
"WAY TO MANY ADS! GREAT GAME, BUT AM UNINSTALLING DUE TO THE AD EVERY 10 SEC!",1
Ads,1
Apps is glitchy and has all the ads. Completely infuriating. Will never recommend it.,1
total waste of time watching long ads every time you do a thing .. not to mention that you can't save your progress to other devices .. i switched my phone and i can't save/retrieve my long progress in the old phone .. can't do it again .. game will be deleted,1
"Ads, ads, and more ads",1
Better play ads rather than play this game,1
have no word to describe,1
It is a great 😊😊,1
"Don't waste your time. It took my longer to download it than it did to play the first intro level and have to watch an unskippable ad before ""noping"" out of the game to uninstall it. Bummer...this could have had potential.",1
"Like everyone else, uninstalled after ten minutes. Spent more time watching ads than playing the game.",1
Way too many ADS only get to play for a minute and ad pops up for more than 30 secs.,1
"For 10 seconds of gameplay, you get a 30 second ad, but fear not, you can watch as many ads as you want even without playing.",1
It's literally not even a game. It's just one big ad!,1
Super game fantasy 😀😃😁😁👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌👌,1
Too many ads,1
!7+(/)(3!+(/+)+-(-&&!)4+$/4-($)295+!_,1
Hang & mostly slow,1
Worst ads. They just ruining the game play. No gamer will like to have ads in between game always .,1
There's a game in you're ads,1
Absolute rubbish. For every 10 seconds of gameplay you have to watch about 1 minute of adverts. Lifes too short to even bother to download.,1
"Don't waste your time. Spams ads sometimes for not even playing a level. If I could give less stars, I would.",1
This game sucks and there is ads every 30 seconds do not download,1
Could of played this for hours but the devs are greedy and u spend more time watching adds than playing a game. Shame,1
"Fun and cute with quick levels but an ad after every single level. It's ridiculous. There's no chance to enjoy the game before another add pops up. No thanks. I want to play a game, not watch an ad every fifteen seconds.",1
Used to be able to play without an internet connection. Now it will give a pop up saying there's no internet and it won't go away unless you have a connection. I've been using flight mode to stop the ads but now that's no longer an option. Uninstalled and probably won't get it again,1
Rounds are extremely short and there are ads after every one.,1
Boooo,1
"Absolutely filled with adverts, Not recommend !!!",1
"Too many ads. Ad after every 10 second level, ad to earn rewards, ad to open crate, ad if you don't open crate. More time watching ads for other bad games than actually pain my the game, even if you skip every one as soon as possible and don't opt in to any optional ones. This isn't a game it's an ad viewer.",1
To many ads,1
"Too many adds, cant focus on the games!!! So annoying!!!",1
You always get ads and I hate ads,1
I will always pay to get rid of ads. They don't even have an option for that and every 5 seconds there's an ad. Uninstall.,1
More ads time than gameplay time,1
Way too many ads.,1
I needed to update this first thing its fine I guess,1
Ad galore!!! Don't bother downloading it. After every single round there's an ad! I understand ads/sponsors help apps grow... But how can you get into a game when there's an ad every single round!! 🙄🙄,1
Way to many ads and no way to avoid them.,1
"This is a Bad 👎 😳 😕 game 🎮. IN FOR OFFLINE I AM FROM LONDON,UK. THIS IS A BAD 👎 GAME FOR SLEEPING TIME THATS YOURE 😴 ALL RIGHT ✅",1
Far too many ads many of which dont close so you have to restart the game. Lasted 20 minutes of which 15 of them were trying to close ads that were the wrong size for the screen and stopped you from playing.,1
TOO MANY ADS!!!,1
Way too many ads👎,1
Horrible waste of time... Rather call it ad watching,1
poop,1
Worst game ever seen lots of ads content,1
Becàuse of ads,1
Boring 😴,1
Too many ads,1
Ads on ads on ads on ads,1
Not too bad a game but oh my god the ads... Not happy with displaying a permant advert on the bottom of the screen but then displays a 30 second advert every ... single... round. That's 30 seconds of advert for 15 seconds of game play. Uninstalled... Simply not worth it.,1
"I'm tired of these game app some of software does not beat red big guy dummy from blue tiny peoples. There issue had problem running some of not respond frozen to beat these big guy dummy from blue peoples.. Issue.. issue.. i'm uninstall these app. Sorry, No Excuse for your app's software issue!... No Excuse!!!",1
"Fun pass time but too many ads. Played 2 games, watched 4 ads and then uninstalled it.",1
Therreable shist low quality game from ad,1
It impossible to get to the top even if you pick the best options it was fun for a day then got bored because it the same thing evey time don't waist your time on this game there are plenty of better ones,1
95% advertising 2% menus and 3% game. Great game idea greedy developer.,1
Full of adverts,1
WE LITERALLY SO BAD I'M LIKE THROWING UP RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE OF THIS APP JUST DON'T DOWNLOAD IT,1
"Too many ads, can't enjoy it!",1
too many ads for a minimalistic game,1
F.O.S.,1
"Trash app, ads right away",1
"so many rubbish ads, finish a game also ads, getting free watch an ad ok, but finush 1 stupid level also must ads, shittier game maker ever!",1
"Far too many long ads. Uninstalled, which is a pity as it was a decent game when you weren't watching ads.",1
Game is nice but in between to many ads pop up eventually it gets boring,1
To much ads 👎,1
Far to many adds,1
WAAAY too many ads. Not worth the download.,1
clickbite ads.,1
Many to many ads,1
Bakwas,1
Ad after every single turn,1
App making you watching endless commercias/advertisment,1
Decent game but ridiculous number of ads. Time watching ads actually exceeds the time playing. Would have kept playing with a reasonable number of ads but will install instead.,1
I have not seen such advertising in any game.,1
"Way, way, waaaaay too many ads!! There's about 30 seconds of ads for every 10 to 15 seconds of game play. Then if you want to upgrade or for bonuses, there's even more ads! Insane!!",1
Download apk,1
"Good game, which I would pay for but Ads destroy it. Deleted by the time I got to level 10…!",1
Um why did did you put a game in your ads? Yall are... stupidly playing a game while ur game is just ads. 90% of ur ADS ARE ADS why did you put a game IN UR EFING ADS?!,1
"This game has way too many ads. Improve it please. Lol y'all should show the number of uninstalls as well, like the downloads!",1
"Holy ads. Ads to finish levels, ads to collect mission rewards, ads to complete buildings.",1
ADSSSSS,1
Not worth this amount of ads.,1
The game itself is fun. The fact that the game forces you to watch ads for as much as or more than your actual time played is bonkers. Completely ruins the game to play a level for ten seconds and then have ads in between every single one. Space your ads out more or offer a paid version without them.,1
I super duper hate this game because there is so much ads. The person who thought that adding so much ads was a hairbrained idiot. so my advice is never play this idiotic game because when I have connection and get new skin it I don't have connection so I hate this game super duper much. And I gave it a 1 star.,1
So many adds !!!!!!!!!,1
So much add!I am angry¡!!!!!😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠 SO ANNOYING! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Enjoyable game in principle, but its secondary to advertising.even if u choose not to claim a power up because u cant be bothered to watch yet another advert, they still hit u with another advert anyway.i now play this game solely offline, so im not forced over and over to watch adverts for other falsely advertised games, which are not as advertised, clickbait, basically ripping us off.",1
Poop games💩💩,1
More ad time than play time.,1
"Another ad filled game. 3 20 second levels in, 3 20 second ads.",1
I will say 1 star cuz there is SO MANY ADDS so if you are a impatient person then I would suggest that you DO NOT NEED TO GET THIS GAME SO MANY ADDS ugh.............................,1
Probably the worstive ever played,1
too many ads,1
2mins worth 20 secs playtime no thanks,1
This game sucks,1
Ad after EVERY...SINGLE....ROUND...It's absolutely rediculous at this point what constitutes a game or really just 1 long a$$ commercial. MONETIZE THIS!,1
"Horrible, not even 10 levels and already saw more than 10ads",1
Boring and wayyyyy too many ads. Cant even enjoy the barely fun game with all those ads. One of the most ads in a game i have experienced.,1
"Too much advertising, didn't like it",1
To many ads,1
Adds are irritating,1
To many ads right out of the gate. They never end don't waist your time.,1
Way too many ads,1
Ad filled annoyance,1
Way too many ads. I feel like I spend more time watching them than actually playing.,1
"You'll spend more time watching ads (even skipping them when you can) than you will playing the game. The levels are very short and easy to complete then you have to watch an ad that is longer than the level took to complete even when skipping the end of the ad. Some levels also stop in the middle to show an additional ad. The game doesn't provide much of a challenge to keep you entertained, and with all the interruptions I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1
"This app charged me 949, 98 Ron (2*474,99 Ron) whithout my consent and without notifying me. I've notified the police, do not download this app. It's full of ads, there is no charge warning, i simply woked up with the money taken from my account and a weekly subscription charged with the above value.",1
Far to many ads,1
Ha ha ha to funny,1
To many adverts need to take some off,1
"Garbage, copy of an original that was also garbage. Ad per level. No sound. Single mode. Ads ads ads, money grab. Trash. Don't ever download this or bother playing it. It's nit worth your time.",1
Again too many ads. Disgusting gameplay!,1
Too many adds also the adds for the game are so annoying,1
You spend more time watching ads than anything,1
Stupid game. Ads everywhere bruh this should be called AD masters.,1
Ads everywhere,1
An ad every level,1
The App has difficulty running with more than 170 characters. Very slow and thr boss fights are lagging when there's big numbers and when it comes to taking damage.,1
"All I can say is, ad simulator.",1
Too many ads,1
Does have potential but no progress saving and too many ads,1
I would play this and reinstall it if I did not get adds between every round of game play,1
Played two levels. Got sick of the ads being longer than the game play. Uninstalled,1
zawzaw,1
No dobro da je u ovom času dolazi iz,1
"Every second. EVERY SECOND during gameplay this game opens my browser with a ""yandex"" url. At first the problem could be solved with airplane mode, but as soon as I unlocked the bear skin and square head skin; EVERYTHING went downhill from there. Completely unplayable thanks to the mountains of ads. You know, you could still have ads- Just don't exagerate with the amount of ads, man. Especially never add ads during gameplay, thats annoying. Will NEVER get games from these guys ever again. 0/5⭐👎",1
So much ads,1
Only for advertising. It is a so-so game where you spend the majority of your time watching long advertisements. If the advertisements were every 4 levels instead of every level it might be worth playing.,1
"One star too, lots of damn ads after each simple step",1
"Good game, but unplayable. Forcing adds on people after EVERY LEVEL is insufferable. I hate games like this.",1
"Ads after every level, and you can only slightly change the outcome",1
Way too many ads without the option to pay to remove them,1
"It, fun but the unskippable ads every round are super frustrating.",1
Keeps lagging and freezes up. Have to force close the game just for it to happen again. Don't waste your time downloading this game.,1
"Hangs after playing any ad, so the app has to be restarted after each level.",1
If you like to watch comercials instal this game.,1
"Dont waste you time, each level takes about 15 seconds and there is an add after every level.",1
We didnt like this game we like like Fre Fire max,1
This game is fun**...but the bad thing is the game is very2 slow & slow game ever!!,1
2 ads in a row after every game... give over Don install,1
Ads damn everywhere not worth the play ads every time you complete a level.,1
Ads ads ads ads ads and more ads it is a very good game although that is the problem,1
Stop downloading these types of games. They are all the same with the exact same marketing strategy and the exact same gameplay. I refuse to watch ads for greedy devs. Even without ads in this game it still makes me want to dishonorably discharge my life from this plane of existence.,1
My brother like this app is beautifull,1
This is ridiculous. More time watching ads then playing the game. Twice as much time spent watching ads then playing the game. Might as well be an ad watching app.,1
"Annoying, ad every 20 seconds. Very disappointing app. Do Not Recommend!!!",1
Adds like crazy for a very boring game,1
Good,1
Too. Many. Ads.,1
So much lag it's unplayable,1
"Too much ads, removed it after 2 minutes",1
This game is unplayable it has so many ads. Each level lasts 10 seconds and then you watch 30+ seconds of ads. It's so stupid. It also does nothing to explain how the game even works beyond the obvious. The developers clearly built this just to make money on ads for other games... Stay away!,1
Great game ruined by ads every 5 seconds. Uninstalled immediately. Not a fan of constant ads.,1
Way to many ads. And they want $3.99 to remove ads?! Not worth it,1
It was ok but the adds are insane. Played maybe 15 min and everything you did was add after add drove me nuts had to uninstall,1
Ads galore! After each game you have to watch an ad to continue.. super annoying!,1
Too many adds on this game,1
Death by adverts,1
Unstialled after the first ad their is ads every level and its so annoying more of a ad machine,1
Too many ads. I've had an ad after each level and makes me less interested in the game each time I play :(,1
لعبة مملة,1
"I'd call it close to worthless considering the amount of ads... The developers must think pretty highly of themselves if they reeeaaally think this ""game"" is worth all that. Would not recommend anyone download this.",1
. Too many ads . Stops frequently,1
Too many ads. Every level you play is a stupid ad for all three same stupid games.,1
Terrible mindless ads with a little game in between.,1
"The advertising master, this app is no other than an advertising machine. The level are about 15 seconds to finish and the ads about 30 seconds or longer depends on the trick they use to keep you on the screen longer. I can't express enough how disappointed this app is.",1
Ad,1
Lots of ads,1
You spend 5 times more time watching adds than actually playing it.,1
Woukd be a decent game but Way to many ads,1
To many pauses between each move for a ad,1
"Short, simplistic game with too many ads!!! Fml🙄",1
The game is very good and entertaining..but waaaaay to many ads you spend more time looking at ads than playing the game so it's a NO for deleting,1
worst game I have ever got iyt is to glitchy,1
Uninstalled after 2 rounds... ads are longer than the game rounds... have no problem watching an ad every now and then but this was too much right from the start.,1
This game is trash. Every level and you have to watch an ad. Its just a game that gets paid with ads. Not fun at all,1
Bad game,1
Worst game gives too much adds dont waste your time ....its totally disgusting,1
Utterly unplayable there are just way too many ads in the games but I should've expected this since it didn't look properly made,1
Too many eds dunt enstl 😄,1
"Short levels but long ads at every chance they got, I played 4 levels got one new skin and watched 5 ads. Why play a game with this many ads. I want to play a game not watch videos, then the ads they play are an insult to the players themselves. Now about the game, poor construction, poor imagination, why give a 10x to get more power to lose almost half to blades or walls or some kind of oblivious pointless battle. Removing and won't be reinstalling.",1
Open an ad company instead of game,1
What to say. What to say. Oh lets see.... First:the game is riddled with ads to the point I had to turn off my phones internet to play properly. Second:the game is basically unplayable and Obsticals that make it impossible to avoid losing units. Third: The lack of originality. This is yet another swipe left and right game with no purpose aside from a quick and easy cash grab. Also the color scheme is boring and stale. Even after 50+ levels there was no improvement. AVOID THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!,1
Nothing more than a vehicle for serving ads,1
Very boring add after every level,1
So many adds every 10 seconds,1
Way too easy of a game with too many ads,1
Boring,1
Never get anything by the developers there are way to many ads in all of their products,1
Wants you to watch an add after every single game,1
WELCOME TO AD WORLD LIKE WHYSSS THERE BILLIONS OF ADS I COMPLETE A LEVEL THEN GRAMMERLY POPS UP ON MY SCREENN WTFF,1
I cNt instle this whys,1
"A lot of ads and the game play is rigged. I can't make it past 130 people because the traps are unavoidable, sometimes I get plus 10 or plus 20 when I need to fight 80 enemies and lose because of bad luck",1
So many ads the game freezes. I'm sure there is a better alternative out there,1
Game for kids 😀😀😀,1
It is crazy that I watch 30sec ad for every 10sec of gameplay,1
Bahut kharab hai,1
Way way way too many ads.,1
It sucks!,1
It was boring,1
Too many Adverts,1
Volinent when you win,1
To many ads,1
Wanted to love this game but WAY too many ads,1
Don't download this unless u love ads after ads an 5 seconds play time if your lucky,1

Too many ads,1
"Gameplay was cool for 10 secs but when you're forced to watch ads at the end of every level, it massively takes away from gameplay. Uninstalled after 2nd level.",1
Too many ads,1
Really good game but the ads are insane like why all the ads but without all the ads it's a really good game and I request it for people who enjoy adding things together it's basically a coutcoulter!,1
Too many Ad's uninsralled it with ib 20mins. Don't bother wasting your time installing it!!,1
There is literally an ad in between every level. Do not waste your time.,1
The ads are on longer than each round of the game. What a pos!,1
Deleted... too many ads,1
Ghatiya game,1
The worse ever,1
bikuk mast,1
Play only in airline mode otherwise you will have to watch an Ad every mission you play. Good way to kill brain cells for all of a day.,1
"Okay, first off, the gameplay is very bland. Not very much skill at all, and the order of skins is already predetermined, not random. With this, so is the crate after each level, making you always get 300 coins as the reward. The ""boss"" is the same boss every time with just a reskin. Then, the worst of it all is the ads. There is an immense amount of ads, about after every game, and to the ones saying to just turn off your internet, that's annoying to do if you need internet expecting a text.",1
easy to play good for youngsters how ever adds need timing back and needs more added to it,1
Boring game,1
"The game does not change much, the levels do not change other than the layout. everything you have to do in order to beat a level is just pick the higher number and avoid traps, the game needs to get harder.",1
Nice game. But the greed of the developer has mad this game stupid. What ever you do is an add. I understand you have to fund the game by ads but if no one is playing it because we waste our time with ads in evert move it every win or every upgrade or even every sudden check on new things. And even when I press get on rewards I have to watch Ads. This is what make a game non playable at all. So I just go uninstalled the app and chances are ...90% of users will uninstall So don't install.,1
I might contribute more ad revenue in the long run if you were not so greedy. I have to uninstall because it just isn't fun with this level of interruption.,1
Lots of ads,1
Stupid game. To many ads (ad after each level). Uninstalled.,1
Too much ads. even after every single level,1
There is so much ads it's so annoying,1
Too many ads,1
Ueuey in hindi Have not received the product Up next time I will be there in the evening or free 🆓 January rent in hindi and heightened in hindi full episode with you and heightened in english for the evening 🌆 and I will call the same time in hindi full of you and your friend bye-bye,1
Good game if you enjoy watching Ads,1
Poop,1
"If your attention span is 5 seconds or less, this game is for you. If ads and very repetitive game play aren't your thing, keep scolling.",1
This is gobar game .,1
Ordinary game,1
The game kept turning my phone off and everytime I unlocked it it would just turn off. This was definitely not my phone because it hasn't done it since. 10/10 would not recommend this game.,1
Advert on every level and some are long ones,1
To many adds,1
A retardgame entirely build around watching ads,1
Played 3 levels and was forced to watch 7 ads nope no game is worth wasting my time like that. How is this a top tier game.,1
i dont like this app,1
Toooooo many adds!!,1
More ads than play time. Nice idea but unplayable.,1
😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
Bekaar game h koi na hi khele toh accha h😑,1
Too laggy,1
Too much add,1
Lots of unusable adds UNINSTALL!!!!!,1
"Bodoh punya game, banyak gila iklan nya",1
I understand putting ads in your game but jesus christ,1
There was too many ads. The game always lagged up my phone every time I went through one of the walls. It even got boring over time because there was nothing really new each round. If I could I would give this zero stars.,1
Too many adds.. Every single level have adds.. Annoying.. Not in mood to play.. Uninstall it!! Waste my internet data!!!,1
Way too many adds,1
"Never had this much lag in any game, it's also ad full",1
"This game started out cute, but I uninstalled it because it was waaaaaay too many ads! I probably only played 4 or 5 games before I uninstalled it. I should have listened to everyone who posted below... Total waste of time!",1
Ads Ads Ads. I spend more time at looking at adds than playing the game.,1
Terrible game. Ad after every... Single... Level... No exceptions. And not just quick easy X ads... Long tricky ones that usually make you end up clicking the ad anyways.,1
Annoying ads after every level.. these are the games thay get unistalled after a couple of levels..at least change so they don't come on as much,1
"Alot of ads... more ads tham gameplay, incredibly short levels...",1
"Very short and repetitive game full of ads. After each ""level"" that takes around 10 seconds there is an ad to watch.",1
After every level you have to Watch an ad,1
"Worst game in a while... Play 10 to 15 seconds levels, see 30 seconds ads, plus ad banners in the bottom Do not install this....",1
Ads garbage,1
No No No,1
Fun game but ads every 15 seconds is just plain bs.,1
Only played a couple of levels could be fun if there wasn't 2 adds at every level. Very frustrating therefore deleting game wouldn't waste time again,1
Enjoyed the first few levels but wow there is an ad after each one and they are 30 seconds long. I will not do this after each stage also I will not pay to have it stop. Thank you for making it easy to uninstall.,1
ما هذا التطبيق السئ😡,1
Nice game but too mch adds uninstalled due to ads,1
"it's literally just full with ads , would not recommend downloading it",1
"I've never played the game, just kept seeing fake playable ads for it",1
Way too much ads,1
Trash,1
"one million ad in each level , boring 😴",1
Lots of add in this app reported this app,1
ad mill. Don't download. Could have been a fun game if it didn't force you to watch ads after every single level.,1
Its so many ads but is pretty game,1
"This ""game"" is nothing but an ad generator. 2 to 3 adds between each level, have to watch a ad to upgrade one stat more then once in a row and the game is designed to make you fail. Do not download.",1
Ads.! Over all good game.,1
Too many adds,1
It's funny but to MANY ADDS. It makes me stressed! I need something to rest. Sorry I'm out! DELETED,1
"Ads after every single level. Whether you choose to get the ad-walled thing or not, you get an ad. Played this for barely 5 minutes and it became apparent that this will be one of those games. Decent concept and I'm sure the actual game is decent throughout but the ads are just ridiculous.",1
"Total waste of time, it's full of ads that get constantly triggered after every level. 15/20 seconds of gameplay followed by a 30 second Too much gameplay in this ad app, uninstalling right now.",1
too many ads,1
Its a very bad game at first it is interesting but after playing some days it really boring,1
"WAY TO MANY ADS!! You can complete the levels easily, but even after the first level be expected to watch an AD, and then after every single level you have to watch one. A pity as could have been a good game",1
Way to long of ads.[),1
This game is medium only not amazing,1
Way to many awful adds for 0 reason,1
Just did not enjoy it sorry.,1
An advert after every everything you do is annoying! Game play is good but lasts about 20-30seconds then an ad! It last 4minutes on my phone then l unistalled it! Less ads and I will reinstall it.,1
to much ads,1
"I am ashamed to have downloaded this pile of garbage. First of all, the ads. If you spend 30 minutes in the game, 20 of them will be spent watching ads. Also, an ad plays every time you beat a level. Want to 'unlock' something? Watch an ad. It is disgraceful. Also, even if you disconnect from the Internet to play without ads, the game is practically pointless. It is boring, with levels that are about 10 seconds long and make it impossible to not lose your people. Extremely disappointing.",1
It is a fun game ruined by the sheer amount of ads in it.,1
"Too many ads. Win level 1, video ad with 5 second wait, picture ad with 5 second wait, download option with 5 second wait, win level 2, video ad with 5 second wait, picture ad with 5 second wait, download option with 5 second wait, win level 3, unskippable ad, download option with 5 second wait, level up plus bonus coins/multiplier, video ad with 5 second wait, download option that still redirects you to App/Play cuz the X is 1 pixel wide, win level 4, etc. Also, most ads are gambling or erotic.",1
Ads disrupt background music. Levels are short and do not live up to expectations.,1
TOO MUCH ADS!!!Despite of all the reviews warning from the too much ads thing I downloaded the game to try for myself! Said maybe it's not that annoying and ppl r exaggerating! Took me less than half an hour to know it's REALLY ANNOYING & UNINSTALL IT! FAREWELL,1
Too much add time,1
Ft,1
It takes forever to load on hotspot,1
Game ok. Way too many ads.. more like ad theb actually playing the game. Uninstall,1
"Play for 15 seconds, watch a 30 second ad, play for 15 seconds, watch another 30 second ad. That's the cycle this game wants you to take part in.",1
Oh nut drame 😠😠😠😠😠,1
"Played two games. Got bored by the ad, every level you've got a video to watch. Completing a level takes less than 1 min.",1
Garbage,1
Bad game overall. Too many ads. Do not install would do less than a quarter of a star if I could.,1
What is this guys? 8s no sense it's poop,1
The levels stayed the same length they are very short and the game is trying to play as many ads as possible.,1
Ads! Ads! More ads!,1
This game has a lot of crash,1
Badddddddddddddddddddďddddddddddddddddfdddfffďffdddddddddd d ddddddd ddddddfdddd,1
Too much ads,1
Annoying ads dont download,1
10 seconds of play then about 30 seconds of adverts EVERY time you play a level!! Seriously the most adverts to gameplay I've ever experienced. Definitely don't let your kids play this is if your using mobile data (or yourself for that matter). If your looking to have a few mins of fun choose something else as its not a game its an app for watching ads. I will be deleting it once I've had confirmation that my review has been put online.,1
Ads Lots Of Ads,1
Ads forever. Urgh,1
Could be a good time killer but unfortunately the ads kill any enjoyability. Game deleted in under 5 minutes. Clearly the developers don't care as they don't respond to what is clearly the main issue to this game.,1
Game's fun but an ad EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU CLEAR A FKN LEVEL is way too much.,1
Too many ad,1
Unplayable due to the amount of ads. Lessen the frequency and you will have a fun game.,1
Too many advertising,1
Its not a game it contains only commercial advertisement.,1
Started to give me brain rot with the absurd amount of ads.,1
Saneev jatav,1
"Would give 0 stars if I could. It's annoying, it's an ad app not a game.",1
It's just ads with a little game thrown in,1
Literally an ad after every level!,1
"Quando abro o navegador, abre paginas de propaganda... Triste desonestidade.",1
"The game doesn't require much tact or brainpower. Levels are short and you're bombarded with ads every 10 seconds which makes for a painful experience. Deleted after 15 mins of play. I'd recommend the app if you like watching ads, otherwise don't waste your time.",1
"Repetitive, boring. Another quickly put together game designed to make money from ads rather than be fun.",1
Ad watching simulator,1
The very first app in the game was impossible to get past.,1
it do suck tho,1
It's fun for 5 minutes but not fun after,1
This game is too much advertisement that is why i didn't enjoy the games!!! 🙄🙄😤,1
Ads!!!,1
When you spend more time viewing adds than playing the actual game *insert clown*,1
Ad bait. Too many games like this on app stores currently. Try and focus on the user enjoyment before the ads and offer a paid for version. Uninstall.,1
"Advert after every level, seriously!!",1
Wayy too many adds👎,1
To many ads,1
Ad time is longer than play time. This game is for you if you'd rather watch ads than play.,1
The amount of ads.. I don't understand how anyone can play this,1
Too many ads,1
Good luck clocking more game time than ads,1
Game sucks. You play for literally 5 seconds and have to watch an ad after every level. You seriously spend more time watching ads than playing.,1
"Boring and repetitive as hell, and plagued with never ending adds for more boring games that will surely be filled with never ending adds. What a stupid business model. Waste of time-spare yourself from this tripe.",1
It's just bad,1
The ads are longer and possibly more challenging than the levels,1
Game is fun but cant play because 30 to 40 second ads constantly pop up.,1
It's an ok game but it feels more like they just made something to make you watch ads instead of making an actual game.,1
Adds,1
There are ads after every level. It's unplayable.,1
Acchi game nahin hai aap mat ke liye ka,1
A game of ads. Ads during play. Ads every 20 seconds. Airplane mode makes the game playable.,1
"More ads, please put more ads in your game!!!!!! It is not enough to have it after each 10 seconds level!!! Why not 20 ads inbetween?? Such a bad experience with your game. It's -100 rate",1
It's very boring! all you do is drag the screen into things? maybe add pvp with real players?,1
"Great concept - far to many ADs.... Level last around 10-15 seconds, level after every add for 10-15 seconds..",1
Way too many ads,1
Poor,1
Too many ads ruin the game play,1
"Too many ads for disgusting games. Not fun at all. Don't install it, it's just an app that full of ads",1
It always has trouble when i try to use our download it,1
Too many ads!!!,1
Ads are out of control. Ruins the game. Deleting,1
Way to many ads,1
"Good game! Interesting! But, once again, and over and over again the ads makes it imposible to play! Congratulations, you made another game not playable!",1
Wayyyy toooo many Ads!,1
Ads takes more time than the actual game.,1
Way too many ads,1
"This game plays like the creators stopped developing it and are just making passive income from it. There's no point to the gems after you unlock the skins. The map stops after you conquer the USA. All of the maps are the same, just in different order of obstacles. If you play this for an hour you've experienced the whole game. Shame of a thing, because there is potential here. They couldn't made upgraded units, stronger bosses, larger castles. Instead it's a revolving door.",1
So we were at a hotel and the add for this game was so loud that people complained,1
Too many adverts!,1
2 minutes of adds for every one minute of game play. Do you really want to sign up for that?,1
"Too many ads, not worth buying. Dave your money and time.",1
So many ads,1
Bad,1
"It's not a game, it's a platform for adverts. 1 level and I deleted it. Absolutely an advertising fest!",1
Good time pass but less game more ads,1
Instant 1 star to god damn adds that won't close when the x is tapped take your game and toss it in the bog of eternal stench! Rarr! 🤬,1
"Fun game, but the amount of adverts is an absolute piss take. I get that adverts fund developers and that's fine, but the ratio of game to adverts is about 10:90",1
It's fun but when I get a big amount of pepole it makes me get less pepole when I was going to get more pepole,1
A good game BUT It lags when more than 150 It freezes when above 250,1
Awful,1
theres something wrong with this game it has a random lag that forces my little people to run threw everything and then it freezes,1
Too much ads,1
"terrible, its full of ads and when you add so many people like 200 and more it was so laggy and you really need to restart the game to back the normal.",1
Too many ads,1
Too many adds,1
Way too many ads. Not worth it.,1
Worst game ever Its not to play just watch the ads,1
"This game would be fun if there wern't so many ads. one ad before and after a game, and if you want to even collect your reward, you have to watch an ad to get it. It's not even a reward at that point! If I could give it no stars i would.",1
It's bad,1
No fun,1
"Ads as hell, rude game.",1
Ad ad ad ad ....,1
"I played offline and when I went back online was hoping for something different, no didn't get it level 151 is the last for me.",1
"I hate that when the game shows me ads, it's like every second bad game!",1
"Incomplete game, no way to reach max bonus at the end of run and of course full of ads. Just deception.",1
"It's a cool little game, but it makes my device very slow. It can be laggy. Lastly too many ads, if you don't want them just make sure your device is not connected to wifi.",1
This is the worst game ive ever played it always vibrate,1
Trash,1
"Boring, too many ads",1
You spend more time watching ads then playing the game.,1
Just constant ads,1
Horrible! Ads none stop! Zero stars for nonstop ads!,1
Too many ads,1
Horroble. The levels are way too easy to beat and it plays an ad after every round(whhich always last too short),1
Way to many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads not enough gameplay.,1
Would be a better game if there wasn't an ad after each level you play,1
Too many ads,1
Way way too much ADS!!! VERY VERY ANNOYING!!!!,1
I probably would play this game all the time if there wasn't an ad after every 10 second level. Sick of these companies taking advantage of people. I'd rather have in game purchases than thisany ads and I have 90% of games with in game purchases.,1
Extremely steppy and when swiping back and forth there is a delay from swipe to the movement of character(s). Graphics are not the greatest. Very plain Jane. Uninstalling.,1
Got about to a boss and the game frooze. Just kept vibrating my phone and wouldn't continue. Closed and reopened and still stuck there.,1
Ad after every level.,1
soooooo bad,1
Incredibly boring watch-ads-to-win game,1
Far to many ads spend more time watching them than playing the game,1
Ad after every level,1
"I only got to that second level and it lagged and then froze, and now it won't work at all. Not a good app at all.",1
"Literally spend more time watching ads than playing the game. It's fun, but not worth sitting through a 30 second ad after every 15-20 second round.",1
This game is just for showing ads.,1
No Win no Download!!,1
The ads annoy me every day,1
so many ads i dont like this game:(,1
Add after every single level.,1
Too many ads to enjoy achievement levels... ..no sense of continuity.,1
10 second levels with 1min advertisements. Horse pucky & bad business practices .,1
Insult to human intelligence with adds,1
"Asks whether you want to see an ad for more reward. Choose no and it shows you an ad, anyway! Without a reward! Also, not a good game, in-between the many ads.",1
"Bad design, too many ads",1
Good Game But Too many Ad came so am uninstall this game....,1
You guys forgot to add the game in between all the ads,1
Ads are horrible! Atleast let me pay for no ads. HORRIBLE,1
Ads make the game intolerable. Absolutely not worth it.,1
Why is this game even allowed. Every 30 seconds of gamplay they show adds.....,1
My phone app not dawnlod,1
why is this in 1,1
It so much lagging,1
Ads ads ads After every time,1
You noob,1
A series of adverts interrupted occasionally by an OK game.,1
"your trashy game is not worth an ad after every single short level. it's just not worth it in any capacity. I get that you have to make money, but this is absurd.",1
Fun little game but too many adds holding you up.,1
Waaaaaaaay too many ads,1
Ads after every single level? Don't waste your time.,1
I like is game,1
Add literally every 10 seconds. Waste of time,1
boring and repetitive,1
to much ads pan ka lora,1
Right off a 45 sec ad after first tutorial that took 5 seconds. Screw that Uninstalled. To make money you need to hook your clientele not drive them away,1
"Kinda fun but way too many advertisements, more advertisements than gameplay. Don't bother downloading.",1
"Unskippable video ad after every. Single. Round. Rounds only last 30 seconds or so, it feels like more time is spent watching ads than playing the game. When you do play the game you can't amass a larger group than, say, 120 because of spinning spikes that take up half the corridor. Not worth it, even when free.",1
Very fun game. Way to many ads. Uninstalled.,1
Takes longer to watch ads than play a level.,1
"The game isn't bad, what makes it bad is the ad viewing system, the laggy controls and the bugs that result in multiple black screens that make this game unplayable. Some refining and debugging is necessary.",1
"I endured 30 mins of this app and had to uninstall it ... out of those 30 mins, 5 mins were of actual game play, the rest were ads on top of ads on top of ads ... way to many ads",1
Body Bura hai,1
To many adds..,1
No good,1
30 second ads for 10 seconds of game play is irritating. No skill involved. Pretty boring game.,1
"So many adds, it's imposible to appreciate the game like this",1
"Fun way to many ads, after every turn! Uninstalled",1
Just trying to make money off ad revenue,1
Algorithmic,1
"1.) Controls are very janky, hard to maneuver . 2.) Within three minutes of download, I get two 30 second ads.",1
What a shame...a great game and concept but ruined by the persistent advertisements that get blasted in your face every 0.5 seconds. The game is actually really fun. The adverts just ruin the experience entirely. I had to uninstall the game. I wouldn't have reviewed this game but I did really like it. The game devs only ask people to review it so it ranks higher on the search polls. Only review if its one star otherwise this game will never be fixed :/,1
I'm not going to lie this is amazing,1
Good game,1
So much of adds between each level,1
This is just ads with a game tacked on to break up the ads. More ad time than gameplay.,1
Worat app ever DO NOT INSTALL gives you ads in the middle of a game,1
So many goddamn ads,1
Jxxx🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕💝🖕💝💝🖕🖕🏿🖕🏻,1
"Would be better if I could play, 20 seconds of game play to 30 seconds of ads...its horrendous dont waste you time with the selfish devs, not even an option to pay to remove",1
Don't give noob ads worst noob,1
"Came to this from DuoLingo... Seriously speaking now, I'm not exaggerating, you get 15 seconds of gameplay followed by 60 seconds of ads. This isn't a game, it's just a bit of software designed to generate ad revenue. Don't bother.",1
Nice,1
Game : 1% Advertisements : 99% (The Most Mobile Ads of The Year),1
👍👍👍,1
Terrible lagging,1
"Uninstalled after level two, and the ads being way longer than the levels. No game is worth waiting thru ads like these to play...",1
Waste of time,1
You consume more time on the adds ratehr the game...,1
"Terrible game, each lever takes about 30 seconds and after each and every single level you have to watch an advert. That's one adver every single minute of gameplay, absolutely ridiculous. Avoiding all games from this publisher",1
Played 5 levels. Watched 2 1/2 minutes of ads for 30 seconds of actual gameplay.,1
Ads on Ads with a little more ads (oh and also gameplay every few minutes for 10 seconds before more ads.),1
Best Ad viewer on the play store!!!!! Almost no interruptions from annoying games!!!!,1
"Far, far too many 30 second long adverts that you can skip. At the start of each level, then when you select the level, then after each level. Takes *so* long to get to the next level, when you're actually only playing for about 39 seconds at a time",1
Stupid ads with a few seconds game,1
Ads,1
"I tried to play but the ads are continually, they make you watch to many ads .",1
"Too many ads, and the game is boring",1
"It takes long when you're going to download it but however that you really good and I actually like the game, but the ads that make it weird and yeah I just don't like to as it takes long and sometimes I just want to press x it takes me to like the game I want to play but I don't want to play again so I do about I'll write this game like a one out of 10 don't like it but it's going to get a good chance",1
Ads after ads after ads,1
Constantly watching add,1
You play for 30 seconds and watch 2 minutes of ads; it's so annoying. I deleted it immediately.,1
The game is not that exciting to wait on ads after every level.,1
Bad game done install👎👎👎 bad,1
You get a 30second ad in between every 20s level.,1
4 games. 4 long ads. No more games. No more ads. Goodbye.,1
"5 seconds of play, 30 second ad. Repeat",1
Too many ads,1
Waste game & Over advertisement,1
You spend more time watching Ada than playing.,1
There are games with ads and then there ad platforms with some game element. This is definitely the latter. You'll spend more time watching ads than playing. Don't bother.,1
تبلیغات خیلی زیاد,1
Remake a game,1
Way Too MANY ADS,1
ADS,1
It's just ad after ad,1
App is trash there is so many ads after a level ADS ADS ADS ADS AND MORE ADS SO ANNOYING 😤,1
"You should not be doing anything with our privacy, to warrant us to agree to anything. I do not mind ads with in reason. But I do not appreciate EULAs and Terms of Service.",1
So much ads,1
"Can't play the game because of ads. Like 90% of time is watching an ad rather than playing. Levels end so quickly so you can watch another ad. The most funny part about the app actually is that it did not forward me to Google play when ""Rate us"" popped up and I clicked 1 star.",1
The ads are so excessive,1
"I liked the concept of the game but way too many ads. In every level you still need to watch ads and it's too annoying. And also, everytime you want to upgrade your character, it's still needed to watch another ads. I think, if you'll lessen the ads the game will be better.",1
Remove this game from the store. Please and Thank you.,1
"Soooooo many ads, you have to watch Way more than your play time. Completely awful to play because of them. Too bad because it is fun. Uninstalled.",1
"Cash or Trash? TRASH, the game is fine but the ads are way too much",1
Waste game,1
Advert after every level,1
Too much adds,1
The most and the longest ads I have seen in a game so far,1
Game is garbage. Can't even go one level without getting an advert. Game play is brainless.,1
😕😕😕😕😆😆😀😁😥😤😕😆😁😢😬😬😂😡😢😯😢😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😂😂😂😉😉,1
This is the best game,1
"The f'ing ads man, haven't played this and never will, just looks like garbage",1
Play for 5 seconds and get a new ad.,1
Good 😊😊👍,1
After every 5 second level there is a 30 second ad... no thanks,1
Every level there is a ad plus a ad while playing the game. This is a ad app with a game.,1
ભઢટફઠણઢ,1
Harshit,1
WAY TOO MANY ADS!!!!!,1
An add after every round,1
A great little game but far far far too many ads. You spend more time watching adverts them playing the game. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.,1
Too many ads,1
10 seconds of game and 30 of ads. Not possible to play,1
"The game has potential to be good, but I'm spending more time sitting through ads than playing the game.",1
Game runs well but it is an advert after every single level. Makes playing it an utter bore. Avoid,1
so so many ads.,1
Ads ads and more ads....lasted 3 minutes playing the game...watched 7 ads and deleted it instantly.,1
Very bad app most discuting 😠😠😡,1
"Annoyingly short 5 seconds levels, after every level there is an add of course, for every button you click you will have another option but with add. And levels are for 1st grade kids I guess. Overall I think this is a perfect game, there is literally no more room for adds, it is maxed out. Maybe if you shorten the levels a bit more, to lets say, 3 seconds, maybe you can squeeze some more adds then.",1
Very worst game,1
Very Nice,1
Too many adds,1
To be my besti to be in real,1
There is more AD time than there is game time. You play 10 seconds and 2 minutes of ADs. I understand there has to be ADs for it to be free but this is ridiculous.,1
"The concept is good, the game is good, I would really enjoy this game if it wern't for the LAG. Not exaggerating, this game literally looks like a slide show that stays 10 seconds on each side.",1
Ads,1
Sooo boring and full of ads,1
Game chagli nhe,1
Purely a money making game through endless ads,1
"Predictable, a good waste of about 5 minutes, more than one form of currency, ads for days. I think I spent more time watching adds than playing the ""game""",1
"Ad fest, no way to pay and remove ads. Highly infuriating waste of someone's talent to push other mobile games which are also ruined by constant ads. Add remove the 5 mins of fun out of all mobile games. Ps they don't work just make me want less.",1
Only adds come.i dont like it...,1
"Adverts actually take up more time than the game, which would be okay if you get to play for more than 30 seconds",1
Takes longer to watch an ad than it does to complete a level and there are ads after every single level.,1
TOO MANY ADS...,1
there are too many permissions you ask for,1
Boring game. Too many ads,1
"Game of Ads, you play ads , a lot of ads instead of a game",1
Pade,1
"I am absolutely sick of this game. First of all, the game was running fine at first despite all the ads, but then I get a bunch of lagging and glitching into the game. Also, how boring and easy it is to finish levels is too much. Like I said, finishing levels is really easy so every time you finish them, there are a bunch of ads. I didn't mind at first because I didn't actually read the other reviews. But it has driven me insane. Definitely not recommended, I'm uninstalling this app right now.",1
"Way too many ads. I understand the developer has to make money, but this is ridiculous!",1
Too many ads that are way too long. Uninstall.,1
Ads,1
Ad farm. Don't waste your time,1
Too many ad's,1
To much ads 🥵🥵,1
Maybe degenerates and kids could enjoy this.,1
Too many ads,1
Pure ads everywhere. The ads take longer time than each level. Do not install.,1
Holy Ads Batman and you can't turn them off.,1
Only install if you wanna see just ads,1
too many ads,1
"Adverts adverts adverts, it's a joke, makes it unplayable",1
Too many ads,1
way too many ads,1
The ads make this unplayable. Between every level and the levels are short and don't really get that hard.,1
ads,1
"After each levels you see ads,why too many ads?",1
Too much add,1
I'm only making this review because of a ad and how much I hate this game because of that ad,1
"I would enjoy the game if I wasn't spending more time waiting to get thru ads than on the actual game. Could be cute, but the ads kill it.",1
Too many ads after each n every level there is an advertisement but for every 15 second there is an ad of 0.45-1 min break,1
Way too much ads,1
Ads are way too much,1
Too many commercials. Everytime I pass a level I watch a commercial. That's dumb!,1
Uninstalled because of all the ads. There was more ad time than play time. I really liked the game itself but really not worth watching all of ths ads,1
So bad tooooo many adds the things not even let you finish 1 game. Socks,1
They just want to make money off of you by making you watch as many ads as they can force you to.,1
Every 10 seconds program not responding ... classic money grab ad ...,1
Very bad gam,1
This game freezes my entire device after 2 minutes of playing. Unplayable,1
It doesn't even work 😭😭😭,1
too many ads,1
Great and watching app. Too bad the and watching is interrupted every 20 minutes by a mini game with blue people.,1
To many adds but still good game...,1
Lag super bad cant even play,1
Good game but da ads da ads I mean it did come up in a and tho but still good game 😂😂😂,1
The number of ads are unreal!!!!!! That's enough to make us delete it,1
Long ADS in every level.. Uninstall yes sir.. See yaa,1
👎🏿👎👎🏿👎👎🏿👎👎🏿👎👎🏿,1
agreed,1
"Ads are unbearable, turn off wifi when I play this game just to get rid of them. Boring game doesn't even scratch an itch when I just try to turn my brain off for a game",1
Many publicity tooo bad 👎,1
. .,1
Noob,1
"While the idea is nice, an ad LITERALLY after every level (and the levels are short) means you watch more unskippable ads then you play this game. It's beyond me why game devs even consider this I'll practice. Don't you want your game to be PLAYED? Surely ads are needed to earn money but there needs to be a balance! Right now (and with so many ""free"" games) the balance is like 60% of the time watching unskippable ads and 40% is playing. That's stupid.",1
Orribile. Ads after every run. Play something else.,1
"If you like 30 to 40 seconds of ad play after every time you play and you only playing for 5 seconds at a time, then this game is for you. Garbage game, need to get ride of 2/3 of the ads then it might be fun. I did uninstall this game after the 4th ad.",1
Worst game ever. .... better not to download.....waste of time.😠,1
Fun game too many adds,1
"Terrible, after every stage an ad. This isn't how you keep people playing.",1
10 second rounds followed by 30 second ads.,1
Okay game but the ads make it unplayable.,1
ads adds addds addds ....,1
Utter garbage. Little more than a constant stream of ads interspersed with brief full moments of gameplay.,1
90% ads 10% game,1
I ignored the reviews... DO NOT IGNORE THE REVIEWS! LOL literally 3 commercials between each round.. Commercials on your home screen. You can't close the game without hard ending the app (can't hit the back button to get out) don't waste your time,1
One match one ad,1
Good game,1
10 seconds of game play then 30 seconds of ads isn't fun...,1
Lots of ads unable to play game,1
Too many ads,1
To many ads,1
"Wow congratulations! The most forced ads in a mobile game! Oh but don't worry, you can watch 2-4 more ads in between each level! Oh and the level is like 10 seconds, so for every 90-150 seconds of ads, you get 10 seconds of playtime. Thanks! Love it! Ignore the 1 star rating. I'm sure it has nothing to do with this awesome ad:playtime ratio.",1
You literally spend much more time watching ads in this game than playing it. Just a terrible experience.,1
good concept the rediculous amount of ads ruins it you spend 2x the amount of time watching ads. I like to get into a game before I invest money into it.,1
Fun game... unfortunately it got unbearable after the fact that after every round there is an ad. Not against ads but maybe make it less intrusive and annoying! Un-installed would re-download if it were fixed,1
Constant ads. Literally,1
So boring game full of ads,1
Actually it is waste. Sa many ads. It takes more time to watch the ad than playing the game.,1
"Ads everywhere, shame on you",1
Boring,1
"Should be called ""ad revenue masters"". Interstitial ads between every level, some of which are inexplicably un-skippable, disrupt the flow of an otherwise amusing time waster game. I think I've spent more time watching ads than playing 😒",1
Adds after every level. It's one of those games you play on airplane mode.,1
Far too many ads,1
"Ad after ad after ad,,, spend more time watching stupid adverts than playing the game",1
Ads after literally every level. They are inescapable and don't even get anything out of then.,1
BORING AND WAY TOO MANY ADS,1
"Ads make u wanna stop playing, as i did. Game is amazing but u cant enjoy the game because of ads.",1
Lots of ads. More ads than play time,1
I think someone made a mistake and put a game in your ad space,1
Far too many ads,1
"Cool games, but too much ads, max 10 seconds of game play followed by 30 second of adds. Frustrating",1
"It's LITERALLY an ad every 90 seconds. I am not kidding. Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads nothing but ads. It's a darn shame too, because it's a fun game.",1
"Number of issues here. 1. You'll spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game. 2. Levels are 45 seconds to a minute at MOST. 3. When I clicked off of an ad, it closed the ad, opened the app store, AND STARTED DOWNLOADING THE APP WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Absolutely do NOT download this game. Only giving 1 star because 0 isn't an option.",1
"I understand that apps should have advertisements, I totally get it, as developers, you should have income as well. However, approx. every 30 sec putting advertisements will make you lose users and income in the end. I am uninstalling this nice game because of annoying advertisements..",1
Bekar app only add de ta he ok good luck,1
The game is fun but holy moly the amount of ads is insane. Its not enjoyable to play AT ALL. I don't see an option to buy the game to remove the ads either.,1
A few seconds of gameplay in between 30 sec ads...,1
Download slow,1
Rick off,1
The slowest game ever and if you survive 50% of your time being ads then you need a life.,1
Horrible ad experience,1
Waste of time. More adds than game. It is rather that you watch adds than paly game.,1
Piss.,1
Bad,1
"This game sucks. WAY, WAY, too many adds and it is so laggy. So, everytime i move it laggs and nocks the little people off. Would NOT reccommend!",1
Many ads,1
"More time watching adverts than able to play the game, very poor",1
Wayyy to many adds mobile gaming really sucks nowdays,1
"Could have been fun but ads destroyed the experience. Once in a while is one thing, bit every 10 seconds? Disgusting.",1
Ads ads and still Ads,1
Way too many ads that ruin an ok game,1
Stupid AF millions of ads,1
Ads but turn on airplane mode,1
Unify Figueroa 5886 Fkj Higher Fkj TV Kj Hm Ymyyi,1
Too many ads,1
Way way way way way way too many ads,1
Ads are too much,1
WAY toooo many ads,1
So many ads you can hardly play the game. Ever so often an ad pops up with an x in the top left corner that no matter how hard you try you can't close out. The only way to keep playing is to close the game and restart. Uninstalling,1
Ad trash. It's sad that we live in a time where the rating of a mobile game directly corresponds with the amount of ads in game. Game COULD be fun. With no ads.,1
This game is an ad simulator more than anything else.,1
Not that fun...,1
"Ads after every single thing you do. Most ads require 3 clicks in order to get rid of them. No difficulty progression. Fun concept, but the game is blatantly just a money grab from ad play",1
What experience? It was just ads. Ads. More ads. Ads. Ads. Don't waste your time. Ads. Ads. Did I say ads? I played for 10 minutes. 8 minutes of that was closing ads. ADS!!!!!! NO ONE CARES ABOUT ADS.,1
"The game is ok... But the ads!!! An ad after each level, and you cant skip them.",1
"Very basic, repetitious boring and way. Too. Many. Ads. Played over 40 levels. Each level finished with an ad. Then you build up a silouette of a bear whoch in turn you have to watch an ad to unlock. If you fail a level you're all but guaranteed to pass the next level. Strongly recommend avoiding, it's a waste of time.",1
Ad AWFUL!!! It takes seconds to finish a level and then there is a one minute ad...between EACH level! SO ANNOYING!!! Uninstalled it after 5 levels!!,1
Poop ruubish,1
Endless ads.,1
Bakwaas,1
"One star for the concept, however the ads are obnoxious and ridiculous they play every single time. If I want a time waster I would watch YouTube.",1
15-30 sec Ads after every 10sec round!!!!,1
"The gameplay is very repetitive, but this in itself may not be inherently a flaw; the problem is that it lags, and I mean a LOT. It even crashed a few times too. Apparently the game can't handle large numbers (about 200+) of little people fighting or even running (which is basically the main feature and goal of the game, so go figure). If this doesn't happen to other people I'd be happy to know and I'll check the other reviews to find out, but this game needs some serious optimization. 1/10",1
Didn't even finish first time playing first game and ads popping up. Wow just horrible.,1
"Too many ads, boring game",1
Because it was taking so late to download,1
"I watched more ads then I played the game, it's a no from me. Delete",1
"Advertisement after every level, considering a level takes less than a minute. No thanks",1
More minutes of ads than playing,1
Playing very big adds for every level abd not so interesting.,1
Worst game & very adful game.I hate this ad,1
Lost me at fake demo that takes you here when you tap the screen. DON'T DO THAT.,1
"The ads are horrifying, waaaay to many ads, the lag makes the game unplayable, and its nit a new cincept or a new take on these kind of games, i reccomend you all go play brawl stars",1
Too many ads,1
"if you wanna spend your time watching ada, tiis game is for you. just installed anf already about to uninstall.",1
IDIOT GAME I PISSED THEM FOR ADVERTISING,1
Each 5 seconds adsss pops up !!,1
Garbage unless you like adverts. You get an add after every level so you spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game.,1
Too Many Ads. Literally every minute you have to watch an ad. Not worth it.,1
I hate this app it's bad do not play it and waste your money no it.,1
An annoying ad-fest.,1
"This game is a scam. When you go to the part when you get your three tresure chests it will never give you the new skin. And you always win, you can never lose no matter what unless you are trying.you should not download this game + it has too many ads Once i downloaded this game my phone started moving ao slow.",1
"It's a nice game, though the amount of Ads is insanely high. Uninstalled since they ruin the fun and you simply can't enjoy the game with a loading ad screen constantly!",1
I played until level four or so when a cop came out and beat my little people to death. Soooo too much like real life I guess.,1
Winner of the most ads per second award goes to you congrats,1
Ads,1
Idiot,1
App spams 300 million ads,1
Not worth the adds. Fun. But holy Jesus with the ads. Uninstalled about 15 minutes after playing. And 10 minutes of that was ads.,1
"I hate your game ad, when I play any online game and your ad show up I click on the x to close it but it crashes my game only that's why I downloaded this game",1
Are the unskippable ads after LITERALLY EVERY LEVEL really necessary? Legit sucks all the fun out of a game that has potential.,1
An ad delivery system with short game play in between each ad,1
Horrabl game,1
Ads won't go away,1
"Game play is decent, but unfortunately you spend more time watching ads than playing.",1
Too many adds,1
This is an ad watching app with small bits of game.,1
Worst ever,1
Too many ads,1
"Fun for a few seconds, but no way near worth it for the number of ads. Bye!",1
Worst game,1
No room for skill nor impovment. The stuff you buy with your gold does not make any difference. This is a game for 3 years old kids.,1
An ad after every level,1
"Its such a fun game but the amount of ads is horrible and so frustrating. I don't think I have ever played a game with this many ads. I played for maybe 5 min before I uninstalled it, and I actually really liked the game itself.",1
I do not know but it is bad for kids & you thank you,1
At my 3rd level I come across a giant police officer that I have to battle. This is propaganda and discrimination. This is a mindless game for mindless people.,1
This game is sooooooooooooooooo good you should totally download it TOATALLY,1
Good luck playing with all those adds,1
"Aggrrssive Ad policy ( every run , sometimes 30 seconds not skippable )",1
Just another game loaded with adds,1
Just repetitive,1
Shove. The. Ads. Up..your,1
Awful game. Just made for adverts. Incredibly simple.,1
"l downloaded this to rate it 1 star ,u are welcome",1
"If you like to watch advertisments, this is YOUR App. ADS, ADS & MORE....",1
This game is Soo bad if you want to move a bit to the right it goes in the corner and after my first game I deleted it because of the annoying ads and I wanted to give this a zero star but we can't post a review with0 start rating and plz guys don't waste your time downloading it they just want more people to download it and get money and show ads that this is not a lagging game and it is the best but in reality it not what is in the ad. I don't even know why some people give it more than 1star,1
Get used to an ad every 10 to 15 seconds. That is literally no exaggeration,1
More adds then game time.. .. creators must just be flat out greedy ..,1
Choppy game,1
Bruh what is this,1
Ad after every single level. Annoying.,1
Hip,1
To many ads,1
This is not game... it is only waste time for watching advertisements!!! I hope google will do someting to prevent developers to add so much adds on games. Maybe maximum 1 add for every 5 minute. Here is add in every 20 sec @,1
"This game is literally trash, like your just bad whoever made it, I don't care suck a butt",1
Way too many adverts.,1
This game does not installing on my mobile this is very bad game,1
Theres an ad after literally every level. Making it not worth my time.,1
"Time waste! I end up watching ads instead of actually playing the ""game"".",1
The controls don't respond the I want it. The game is laggy as well.,1
After every play you game there is an ad so yeah you watch more ads then you play games dang Jesus Christ,1
A zero star. Ads takes more time than playing. Are you even reading our reviews?,1
THIS GAME IS FUN,1
This game is a turd sandwich. Due to the fact at every level you are forced to watch an ad. You're forced to watch an ad every 10 seconds it feels like.,1
19 seconds play and then 40 seconds advert on just about every level.... more adverts than playtime....not cool!,1
Not soo good it hangs a lot in between..,1
The ads are a real turnoff.,1
Too many adverts.,1
Too much ads,1
More adds than gameplay,1
This game very ridiculous 😒 zero star,1
"If you enjoy choosing a larger number over a smaller one, and then having a 25-second advert every 5-seconds of gameplay, then this is the game for you!",1
"If you are playing to reach above 6.8x , uninstall now. Cause you never will reach above 6.2 and will only have 250+ people in the end max.",1
Too easy,1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD ...TOO MANY ADS,1
So many adds Jesus christ,1
Dont bother.,1
😀,1
Ad ware,1
Any app that has such a long and detailed privacy policy want my info vs wants to keep it private.,1
Its more advert than gameplay,1
Full of advertisment,1
"Very bad .. the character is so primitive and when i downloaded it, it broke dwon and made me lose forcefully .. ugh",1
I can't play the game,1
TARU N,1
Personal opinion but it's way to simple.,1
Absolutely sucks! Ads every 10 seconds. Boring game,1
"Fun when you can play it. But that's rarely. It has buffering every time it has an ad, goes unresponsive, makes you freeze in a middle of a run and lose out on diamonds. Uninstalling.",1
Far too many ads,1
"Levels take 15 seconds or less to complete. EVERY level is then followed with a 15-30 second add. More than 50% of your time playing this is spent watching ad's. 1 star, terrible.",1
Not playable And the game is to many things to do,1
its boring the levels like always like a level 1 and its anoying i hate this app and its always vibraition I am wasting time at this game. so stupid！！！！ I really hate it. i rate one star beacuse its stupid game.,1
"The amount of advertising is rediculous. I'm not joking when I say the round is over is 10 seconds, but you need to watch 20seconds of advertising in between. And you can't even buy the thing so it is built for the sole purpose of serving ads. There are better things to do with my time...",1
"This is not really a survival game, other than in the most simplistic mathematical way (if you have more people you win). Nor does speed have any impact. Each level is merely rinse, wash, and repeat. No multiplayer, but any internet connection is used for ads; lots and lots of ads. Within 3-4 rounds I had seen just as many ads. Good for approximately 5-10 minutes.",1
Honestly belongs in the trash because these ads are killing my patients,1
Boring once you have built all the buildings to man the ships there is nothing else. Building up diamonds is pointless as nothing to do with them.,1
"Isn't a game, its an ads app ☹️☹️",1
Too many ads,1
Ads and more ads Fun easy concept but ads take up the same if not more time than the game play itself,1
Tons of adds! It's like you play a level for 10 sec and then watch adds for 30 sec. Not worth it.,1
👎👎👎,1
"Potential for a great game, however watching too many ads. Completely ruins the game",1
ADS! would give 0 stars if I could,1
Dumb game,1
THE game.is bad and FREE FIRE is the best,1
The game would be fine if it were for the 50000 ads. It's not even worth playing.,1
"Interesting idea and concept, but way too many ads.",1
10 to 20 second levels with up to 2 x 30 second ads inbetween. Absolutely not.,1
Too many ads.... can't get around it. Terrible game@,1
"Spend more time watching adverts then playing the game, 15-30 sec advert per super quick game. Complete money grab..",1
Commercials every 30 seconds. Not worth playing.,1
Force to watch 2 minutes of adds every 7-15 seconds of game play is absolutely rediculious. Also every so many matches your forced to watch 3x the ads to continue (Even if you dont want the bonus junk). Close the app and move on to something else.,1
àbsolutly bad gale,1
Too many ads,1
Too short. Too many ads. Ads are longer than the game itself.,1
"Uninstalled after 5mins. Bunch of ads, restrict internet data for app, still downloads ads. No thank you",1
hate the game,1
"Watching an add every 30 seconds is not my idea of fun. This ""game"" is just an add nightmare.",1
An ad after every level is tacky game design. It's annoying and frustrating to wait/click through three close buttons for the next level. Immediate uninstall,1
Too much ad 광고 너무심함,1
"Uninstalled! 10 seconds of game play, 30 seconds of adds, no thanks.",1
This app is just filled with ads.,1
Worst,1
All ads,1
Have you read their privacy policy? Total overstep for such a mindless game. I refuse to play it based on their privacy policy alone.,1
Way too many adds,1
"Man muss nur ein bisschen rechts und links swippen, das Spiel hat 0 Anspruch. Nach jedem Level min. 30 Sekunden Werbung",1
There are more ads then games,1
"Just a game to show ads. You play for a few seconds and then watch an ad that takes longer than game play. Even when you skip the ad for the rewards, you still have to watch an ad.",1
Terrible. Played 2 levels and after each I was faced with an ad that lasted exponentially longer than the level. When you spend more time watching as than playing then the balance is way off,1
WHOEVER DOES YOUR ADS IS RETARDED,1
Every screen stars from ad,1
🚴🚴🚴🚴,1
All ads... Basically is all ads. Don't bother,1
Ads ruin the game,1
"Too much forced ads, not recommended",1
Too many ch ads,1
Too many ad! It's a really painful!,1
You people are the worst clearly the most disliked people in the office,1
Full of ads!!!,1
don't download this game,1
This game is a country of ads For this I give one star,1
Bad,1
if you want us to play then let us play. Don't show rediculous ads. only one star for ads,1
Way too many ads,1
Forced ads with no way to stop it. Couldn't play it 2 rounds.,1
Unskipable ads every lvl..like every 10 sec .. unplayable trash,1
"Nothing but Adverts..! Spend more time closing down pop ups, don't waste your time..!",1
Ads every 10 second of game time,1
this game is too much bad it shows too many ads ads ads literary so many ads added in it in every 20 second the ads start,1
"When you spend more time watching ads than playing the game, you know the app is a waste of your time.",1
Nice,1
So many adds,1
Your little icon either speeds up or freeze on you. Have little control on direction you want to go.,1
Boring game jk,1
Way way way way way to many ads,1
Who gave this 5 stars? I guess they like spending more time watching ads than playing the game.,1
Cash grab,1
"Wondeful water of time game. Never seen so much AD, AD and AD. No challange at all, only AD",1
Its so boreing and all you do is the same thing and also there's so many adds like they just want money or something i would give it a zero if i could,1
Tooooo many adds,1
"Downloaded, played three levels, watched 10 ads, uninstalled",1
Same thing over and over. Short run with an ad after each run. You spend more time watching ads then playing.,1
"Spend more time watch retarded ads than playing the game, gave up after 3 levels",1
Every 2 seconds an ad appears dont download very bad game,1
Total cash grab. Has long ads that you cannot skip and appear a lot. Would not recommend even downloading this insult of a game,1
"Terrible, much too many ads",1
Repetitive and bland. Could have potential. Ruined by loads of advertising,1
to many ads,1
It's fully advertising bad very bad😠👎👎👎👎,1
Waste of time... thought it would be a fun game but it just repeats rounds after only a short time playing and doesn't get more challenging or fun. AND the ads after every round is ridiculous... and not just normal ads but very long ads with three and four clicks to close the ad and get back to the game.,1
Only ads,1
Ads ruin the 10 seconds of game play,1
Pangit pag dumami ba yung mga tao nag lalag,1
"0/5 stars. Only gets a star so I can add a review. After EVERY level, you get hit with an ad. Worse, the ads are repetitive. If I wanted to play Fishdom, I'd have installed Fishdom instead of this junk! I've seen more Fishdom content than I've seen of the actual game content. 'Tell us more. (optional) Is this game fun?' I don't effin know, because I spent more time on ads than the game!",1
Game is ok....but i don't want to see advertising after every game...i understand developer need money but it doesn't mean you make a whole movie of advertisement.,1
The fact I have to have data on to play is absurd,1
Worst game I ever played,1
Ads. ADS after every single level. Uninstaller after just 3 levels. Not worth it.,1
WAY you many ads! Takes the fun out of what is otherwise kind of a neat game concept.,1
Genuine malware. Ads so poorly integrated they crashed my phone.,1
5% boring game play 95% unskipable ads,1
"The game is fun enough but it always crushes whenever I make more then 200 stick figures, which defeats the purpose of the game.",1
Can't play a game with this many ads With so many ads it's not fun at all,1
"Boring, repeating",1
"This had to be one of the most mind numbing experiences I've had with video games. Holy F bomb. Not only was it painful to play, but also there was an ad after every level, an ad after every level up and an ad after every ad. It made me wanna go play Parappa the Rappa or Ray-Man. Actually, Ray-Man wasn't that bad...",1
Very dirty game don't download,1
Super laggy,1
Download if you want to watch a lot of ads.,1
"Wow, it's just as after ad",1
I was at 250 people but then it lags so much that it went to 25 people and I'm so upset.,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Too much ads and way to exit,1
Glad the install screen was still here. Made hitting uninstall so much eaiser. Play for 10 seconds then have an advert you have to wait 5 second for to skip it. Then flash a screen up. Then rinse and repeat every 20 seconds or so. Money grab from hell this one.,1
I undestant ads are important for the game... But seeing an ad after every level is too much.,1
Totally west of my time. So many ads this is a irritating.,1
Too much advertising,1
This game is way laggy!,1
doesn't downloading,1
Stupid developers.....kill the game with 30 seconds of ads for every 15 seconds of gameplay. Why would you ruin a game....it's unplayable almost immediately due to too many ads. Why not get people to enjoy a game and show a quarter of the ads instead of forcing them to uninstalling it immediately because the ads make it unbearable.,1
ADS BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY GAME = NO THANKS,1
"It's riddled with ads, ads during play, between levels and to open creates. I get that it's there to provide revenue but there's too many of them, pass.",1
Anybody that gave this app above 2 stars is lying,1
Jm,1
"horrible, so many ads",1
Unfortunately can't give it minus 100 stars! Common guys! Do you really want people to enjoy your s..t or just want to annoy people and avoid all your stuff?,1
Ad only.....no game there....pls do not download🙏,1
Too many ads,1
ADS!!!,1
This game is not nice watee,1
Too many ads,1
"This game has problems, and these problems are extreme. 1. I get lag before I reach 200 players and it's extreme 2. The levels are way too easy, make them harder!!! 3. The bosses aren't even half as easy as the level. The main thing I'm trying to say is fix these problems. P.S I like games that are a little bit more of a challenge. Instead of them being easy. Then they'll go by too fast, and the games that are a little bit more of a challenge. Are more popular and they last longer.",1
Absolutely riddled with ads ..dont bother,1
To much ads so annoying,1
THIS GARBAGE IS TAKING 15 MINUTES THIS BETTER BE FUN,1
Adds suck - another fun game ruined by too many adds.,1
The ads are longer than the levels it's a complete waste of time,1
Just useless if you're gonna make a game then make it have more than 2 frames per second. And don't spam ads every 5 seconds😠😠😠😠😠,1
Ads after every round? No thanks.,1
Don't waste your time,1
Too much publicity,1
Wayy to much ads...,1
After 5 min. I had to delete because there are way too many ads,1
Absolute adfest! Uninstalled.,1
Sathisha,1
im still downloading,1
"Terrible, so many ads and you always finish with the same number of people and very rarely get anything above a 5.4x",1
Fun concept but I spent more time watching ads than playing,1
One of those stupid as farming games,1
Very heavy ads. Very annoying when I have to actually interact with the ads to make them end. I'm sitting here watching the countdown hit zero and waiting and waiting until I realized I have to tap something on the ad to get it to actually end. It's like a bunch of retarded monkeys broke into the developers office and just started pounding on keyboards. Some people should find real jobs.,1
Wah wah wah kiya games hey zabardast 🥰🥰🥰,1
It froze on the first level,1
"Unplayable too many ads, dont even bother to download this.",1
Very bad service Bad game but huge storage,1
Too many adverts. If you'd rather watch adverts more than play the game then this is for you.,1
This game is garbage it is impossible to win at and it is very laggy!! Do not download this this game sucks,1
A game is constantly showing up while I just casually want to watch my daily dose of advertisements...,1
"What is this ..huh, ? there was so problem in this game... such a nonsense and stupid types game it is!!! when I was download and try to play this there was held many distrubed situation inthe game. .. now I will uninstall this game and I will hate this game too much!!😡🤬",1
The amount of ads in this game gives an itch in the back of my neck only a dubble berrel shotgun could scratch.,1
Too many ads. Potentially entertaining and fun to play. But ads after every screen you complete takes the joy away.,1
Too many ads,1
So many adds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!why?,1
Fun for 5-7 seconds,1
"20 seconds of gameplay, 30 seconds of ads, lather, rinse, repeat ad nauseum. Wish I could give a 0 to this and similar games.",1
"Absolutely terrible, ads after 2 simple levels. Please "" game makers"" we know you have to make money so perhaps ask players to view an ad to get a bonus/ reward then we're both winners. You probably won't even read or respond to this comment, prove me wrong please.",1
"The main aim of the game should be to play and not to see the ads. For a 15 second duration of the game, we need to see a 35 second ad. Uninstalled",1
Adverts every 10 seconds spoilet it.. deleted straight away.. shame,1
It kept crashing every time I fought a boss,1
Could not play more than 30seconds without an ad popping up. Would not recommend.,1
Kamal 2 😎🤗😣😎🙂,1
To much ads,1
Too many ads even more than one at each level.,1
You will die from adds,1
Would be decent but there are way too many adds and they run for too long. 2 minutes of playing makes for 10 minutes of watching adds.,1
Advert from start and advertising longer than play time!,1
"More adds than the actual play time, waste of time. After conquering all 4 zones, there's no more new zone. After one hour, the game gives you no new challenge to play for.",1
Not nice at all in the add ithought it pro but no 👎👎👎👎👎💩💩💩,1
It won't download I want this game to go up in flames,1
"Too boring,simplistic and too many ads",1
Good,1
"because, this game just paused so i can't play anymore.",1
"I understand you want Ads on your game to gain a little extra revenue but seriously, Ads almost every click, you watch more Ads than you play, it's ridiculous and unplayable, I've uninstalled this now, shame because it's quite a decent game. Should just sell it, not have it as a free install.",1
It's not a game. Its just a app to see ads.,1
"I understand the need for ads, but this is ridiculous. Game itself is cute but not worth the amount of ads.",1
"Id rate it less if i could, what a waste of an addictive app, you have to restart the game after every level with unskippable ads, in fact non passable apps, dont even bother for curiosity, everyones saying the same",1
Very bad game Please don't download this game,1
Its a worst game ever !,1
"Wayyyyy to many ads it's unreal, deleting",1
"Advert after every level, a decent game to kill time but Jesus the ads are overwhelming, I don't mind in game ads at all but this is Overkill......avoid it",1
"So much potential, but the adds killed it for me. Uninstalled. I would definitely played the game if it wasn't made for adds only.",1
"Fun game except for 75% of the time there is a non Skippable ad in front of you, ruins the experience, I know companies need to make money but you also need to entertain and retain your users for longer then 5 minutes without me being so inundated with ads that I wish to cut my limbs off.",1
A lot of ads in this game. It's so irritating while dealing ads on every half minute.,1
"Too many ads, also didn't post my review when I gave them 1 star",1
SO MANY ADS,1
Advert after every level. Unplayable,1
Too many ads.,1
The ads are unbearable,1
Too many ads... I can't take it anymore. Uninstalled!,1
Ads every 20 seconds,1
"Way, way too many adverts. From the few levels I played before deleting, the game didn't seem all that.",1
MIN TO KATEBASETE KOLAEI PARA POLI!!! <3,1
Unplayable with the amount of ads,1
Why is there so many ads as if its one of those games where you make money playing it?? Absolutely no need,1
Too many adds. Keep it simple no need for skins and building,1
Absolute joke. You spend more time watching ads than playing. This is no way for new users to evaluate the game to guage if it's worth buying. Uninstalled after 10 minutes,1
"Too many ads. Game could be fun but the experience is garbage due to way too many ads. It would even be better if there was a ""pay to play"" get rid of ads option but nope.",1
Nonsense! Too many adds. There are more adds than the play time,1
Every time when I get over 200 people the game frames drop like crazy. It's really stupid.,1
Advertadvertadvertadvert,1
Op,1
One level of 10 seconds followed by one add of 30,1
"Got to level 70. False sense of progression, upgrades meaningless with no impact on leveling up. Counting fails to stimulate mind to a chalange. Dumbed down. Has potential just wrongly executed.",1
"After every round, 30seconds to minute in ads... DISAPPOINTED",1
Ads after every single 5 second level... ratio of ad to game is 6:1.... what a joke lol please save yourself and don't download,1
My favorite color is both,1
Samity,1
"Ad trap, sometimes throws you an ad you can't leave from without going to the app store or closing the app and re opening it. Its infuriating. But if you like ads, this game is for you,",1
Good game BUT te adds OMG had to uninstall,1
"I'm telling you, don't even waste your time downloading this. You can't even play for 20 seconds without an ad. I'm not joking.",1
Really enjoyed the game but uninstalled as way way to many ads,1
To many adds,1
Souch ads I hate it I wish your game gets banned,1
"Worst game ever for ads. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game. If I wanted this experience, I would watch TV",1
"Its a very simple game, can become addictive, but that addiction is thwarted by how many adverts you get. After completing a single level, you are forced to watch 5 seconds of an ad or 30 seconds if you want to unlock the extra's. This is where the developer gets extra cash from. There is no in-game purchase to remove the adverts.",1
Just an add game. Thousands of adds. Spoils a decent game. Delete.,1
30s gameplay 2m ads and repeat,1
This is not a game. It's an loop of ads. Don't waste your time downloading this junk.,1
The amount of ads present is unbelievable. Can't get past one level without a 30 second ad,1
Plagued with adverts,1
Spent more time watching ads than actual gameplay.,1
Boring,1
"too many ads, 1 ad for every game played, i understand they need to make some revenue, but that is just too much.",1
Only ads,1
ALIF,1

"Too many ads, Gameplay gets old after a few minutes.",1
Too much ad,1
"Kinda fun, but the Ads are as long as the rounds of game play, running ever other round. Don't waste your time on this one.",1
Too many commercials/ads... deleted game within First 3 minutes,1
There's an ad after each level. I got to level 5 before I gave up.,1
Just an other ads app with mini game inside it(full of ads),1
Too much ridiculous ads! 😑😑😑😑,1
"Literally spend more time in ads than playing. The game is a time waster, so maybe this doesn't both some people. Like, ... those who love to watch paint dry.",1
Utter Non-sense,1
"These ad greed's game are criminal, almost every level they make you watch a 30sec ad. After 1 hour, you probably end up watching more ads then your entire life. I am a sucker for wasting 1 hour of my life and it also drain your battery.",1
Really repetitive and way too many ads,1
ADS ADS ADS COME AND GET MORE ADS,1
"Wayyyy too many ads. After every single level or attack, you're forced to watch 1-2 ads. Id actually pay for an add free version otherwise.",1
"The levels are boring and about 3 seconds long, the game itself sucks and on top of making a boring game, these scumbags decide to put an ad after every single level and to unlock theyre dog water skins. Just walk into heavy traffic whoever made this pile of mega do do",1
This was not a very good game. There was an ad after the very first level. This game sucks don't get it. The game basically only gives ads. There are like more ads than levels.,1
Its so laggy and it has too many ads ill uninstall it,1
Very basic gameplay. Basically an ad machine.,1
NOT EVEN. GAME FOR PAWNS. ADS ADS,1
This is the best game ever,1
It's a giant add app with a easy game integrated.,1
Way too many ads,1
Bkwas game wahiyat,1
Awesome if you want a game full of far to many ads. Its a joke. Especially when you get a crypto ad which doesn't allow you to close it due to a bug,1
"The creator put too many ads which forces other to tunr their wifi off just to play without ads. Yo creator, if you want shitloads of money, then make a game that is exciting and has a lot of unique things to it then add a shop that consumes real life currency but don't make it a Pay to win game, just put it there for the people who wants to play an easy going game.",1
Trash,1
Uninstalled after 5 minutes. 1 min playing and 4 watching an ads.,1
"If you added sounds and didn't have an advert every bloody level it'd be ok, spoilt by too many adverts!",1
"This game fir kids, why you put ads evrey level ? Ads evrey 30 second !!!!",1
Great game but .. WAY👏TOO👏MANY👏ADDS👏,1
Unplayable to many adverts!!!!!!!,1
"The game sucks (no offence) but in the bonus level when ur men arent that many, the giant gets about 6-7 hits and his life goes down like a slug, contrary to when u have many men, then his life goes down quiker with just 4 hits. Not cool men👿👿",1
Too many ads,1
More ads than game,1
Worst game in Play Store,1
Ads,1
Ridiculous amount of ads and no option to pay for no ads.,1
Very bare bones just a lazy app,1
Every time I get a chance to watch an ad they interrupted with a game.,1
I hate it,1
"Not a one star . On everything they are providing ad , if you are playing then you only see ads, and it will take your whole mobile data beaware of these frauds . Showing ads making money irritating people, why google is allowing these type of things on playstore.",1
It is very bad game,1
"the game is so damn stupis like what??? It gives me ads every time i complete a level, the ads FOR the game are treating me like im stupid. The game is also laggy. I have a REALLY good pc and DAMN THIS IS TOO LAGGY.",1

2-3 reclame la fiecare 1 minut. O mizerie.,1
"I understand the adds, but you play 1 quick level and then an add nope, and it won't let me put zero stars why,",1
"Do you enjoy watching ads more than you like playing the actual game? Then this is the app for you, because that's what you'll do, you'll literally watch ads, after every single level.",1

"I downloaded it just so I can give you one star, for ads that don't ever end and block me from playing other games.",1
So bad bcoz when I get super multiply the game is lagging,1
So fun,1
Way too many ads,1
Way too many ads. Couldn't play more than 5 levels without getting sick of the ads.,1
full of adds. you play 1 round and you get bombarded by adds,1
Every click in the game has AD what confused me very much,1
Would be decent if there wasnt an ad after every single run even if you can skip after 5 seconds its annoying.. cant even find a way to pay to disable ads so im sorry to say but im done playing,1
"Asked me to rate after playing only a little, so I put 1 star as I haven't played enough yet and then it crashed immediately after",1
😭 😭 😭,1
More advert time than game play,1
Bad game. Game stutters. Too many Ads. Can't play. GIVE ONLY ONE STAR.,1
Unplayable with so many ads. It's more of a cashgrab for the creators than a game meant to be enjoyed.,1
Its boring,1
Too many flipping ads. An ad every single time you play or advance is just insane. Uninstalled immediately.,1
You made the controls of this app getting stuck!! Why?!,1
Bit boring. Ads after every level!!,1
King,1
Played 5 levels then deleted. Each level took 15 seconds followed by a 30 second add. Waisted 5 minutes of my life with this game.,1
More time watching adds then playing. Garbage.,1
"Unbearable amount of ads, I mean after each game you've got a bloody cryptocurrency ad.... Uninstalling now ..",1
Too many ads,1
What the hell is this waste of stupidity?,1
too many ads that causes lag,1
"😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 ❎❎❎❎❎ ❎, ❌❌",1
Nothing but ads.,1
Too much advertisement....,1
To co concerned with ads 10 sec. Of game play then 30 sec. Of ads,1
"A run is 20-30 seconds. And after every run there is an Add of 1 minute. So if you wanna watch adds instead of playing a game, u should download it",1
Managed to play the stupid game 2 times while having 4 ads that were 2x the game each. Game play is pointless and the ads being longer than the actual game play. Only good note is some of the ads are interactive and more fun than this actual game.,1
Ads,1
I simply think there are too many ads.,1
what did i just play?,1
"Too many adds, unplayable",1
So Bad so many ads 😤😤😡🤯🤮🤮,1
Agin you started adds so bad I am deleting this app now ok,1
"Looks like fun and challenging game but with an ad after even the very first level, then after next couple I've uninstalled right away. I get that ads support the developers, but you need to give people chance to play and enjoy before slamming them with ads....",1
"The most add riddled game I think I have ever seen, boot up the game, theres an ad, beat a 20 second level? There's a 30 second ad, get a reward? There is another god damn ad, this game was lazily made and this company is a huge dirt spec on the play store.",1
Too many ads,1
2 ten second ads in between every level which is about double the length of the level,1
Ad every time u finish a levelz dont download,1
"Each stage takes about 10 seconds to complete. Following that is an Ad that plays for 30 to 40 seconds. It does this over and over. I don't really recommend this game to anyone, as you abuse in-game advertising.",1
Ads are sooo boring and looong.,1
Its like all the boring games that are popular right now😕,1
"Browser ADs break the game The game itself is fun, but with around 10 minutes playing, I already had to close 9 browser ADs. The worst of it, is the fact that this happens during the game, without warning, without even pausing the game. It just suddenly switches from the game to your web browser just to load an ad. A fast passed game like that should not keep ""switching apps"" during the game without even pausing it. Uninstalled.",1
The amount of ads on this game are absolutely ridiculous,1
The ads are asinine!,1
Never played it lol,1
Mechanism is really bad needs too much improvement,1
Way too many ads. Ridiculous. Uninstall.,1
Nice job guy's love!,1
SO MANY ADS. This was fun but there was an add after every single step or level.,1
Think I found one of the worse games possible the layout is garbage. It's pointless trying to get a big crowd cause they always die from the stupid traps so why even make it an option to gain 100 people then just turn around and lose a bunch of them from a hole in the ground or some stupid spinning trap that you can't get out of the way of no matter what. Feel like this was like a 3rd grade class project to make a game and this is what they came up with.,1
Ad ad and only ad in this game,1
"The ads are longer than the actual game play in the levels...and there's an ad after each level. Spent more time watching ads than playing, so uninstalled.",1
Anúncio é o que há.,1
Too many ads,1
Full of ads,1
"Far too many ads, sort it out!!!",1
"Uninstalled after about 8 levels which took nearly ten minutes to play. I say play, what I mean is, it took almost 10 minutes to watch all the 30 second ads after each 15 second level that usually you can't even skip! Should be renamed, mobile ad simulator.",1
90% watching adds 10% playing,1
"The amount of ads is ridiculous. Very short level (4 moves) and a 10-15 second ad. I played for 5 minutes and uninstall this ""game""",1
Short levels and far too many adverts!,1
terrible game SO MANY x1million ads,1
Never loads. Pending Pending Pending. But Never loads,1
"A level is not 20 seconds and you get two ads after every level that are about 30 seconds. No thanks. Potentially fun, but the excess ads ruin it.",1
Unplayable because of too many adds,1
This is a terrible game I do not recommend to anybody,1
العلان فاشل لكن العبه معفنه فعلان,1
Its a good game in and of itself but the advertisements are ridiculous. Even offline there are advertisements every five minutes,1
More ads than playtime. You have maybe 10 seconds of playing followed by an ad or two before it all repeats itself.,1
Just a trash game made to push ads,1
"Not much of a game, more of an add showcase...",1
Same opinion as everyone else. TOO MANY ADS!! I'm over this game won't reinstall unless that's removed,1
"Ads for every round, all i can say is...FU!!",1
Garbage. And app to watch ads. On ocassion you get to play a game in between.,1
"I couldn't even get on to the app! Sure, the phone I am holding is old, but this has never ever happened before! To summarise that in two words 'one star'.",1
A container for adverts. A pity as I like the idea.,1
Literally more time spent watching ads than the game. It's like the trash game is a mini game for an ad machine.,1
"Bland. Boring. Simply bad. Impossible to play with Wifi on, due to the insane amount of ads and short levels. The ""obstacles"" are usually placed in a way that will force you to lose characters. Yet again - a cheap cash grab",1
"Terrible, wouldn't register my inputs at all. I couldn't even navigate the menu, let alone move the character left or right. Not worth sneezing at.",1
Don't mind watching adds but when a game makes its too obvious it's annoying,1
The ads are just too much. You will absolutely spend more time watching ads than playing,1
For every 30 seconds of gameplay there will be three minutes of ads. Plus the entire time you're playing there's even more ads at the bottom of the screen.,1
There's literally an unskippable ad seconds into the game,1
"Holy ads, Batman.... not worth it.",1
"This is a fun game except for the fact that I turn off my wifi so I don't get ads which makes me lose all my bonuses y'all are really that money hungry and deprived, y'all are depraved pathetic losers for that and this game is terrible because of it I will be deleting it right now. I deleted this game within 5 minutes of first playing it, do better.",1
Just an advert basically. Even switching on airplane mode and switching off mobile data and WiFi the game still pushes adverts.,1
Ads right off the bat,1
Omg I normally do good reviews but THIS GAME IS TRASH 🗑️ it. Might start of could and you think ooo this is a good game ! But there's so many ads and Ads give the person that made the game money this is a bad game don't download it !,1
"Ads simulator. You want reward-watch ad. You won something-watch ad to gain. 2 ads for 1 lvl. You want xhange colors for your troops-watch ad, you want to watch ad? Eatch ad and another one ad",1
Literally an ad every round on top of every other thing you can claim watching an ad.,1
Ad after every level. Level takes 30 seconds at most. Totally not worth it.,1
"SUPER glitchy. Not an occasional glitch. Consistently glitchy. The hard part isnt having enough numbers. It's dodging the obstacles when one second you ""here"" and the next second you're WAY over ""there"" AND having enough numbers, subsequently. The concept is as advertised. But it doesnt play as smoothly as you'd expect. I wouldn't even consider it playable at all. Updates are probably being applied to the wrong areas of the game.",1
Game difficulty level is very easy need to develop it more challenging,1
Never played a game with so many ads downloaded played for like 5 minutes then got rid of it cause of ads,1
Ads with some gameplay in-between,1
Terrible game you can barley do anything without having to watch a add every 5 seconds,1
"Sooooo ads, don't install it",1
"Even if you play offline to block ads the game is just... boring. Even for a time waster there are way better games out there, games where the creator actually put effort into the game... I'm sure you'll find them.",1
Worst game,1
Lot of ads... definitely don't install it,1
Unlimted ads poor graphics,1
To many stupid ads 😒,1
"Boring , had to uninstall",1
Too many ads... delete,1
Too much advertisements,1
Ad every 10-15 seconds,1
More adverts than game play! And adverts that come up muted but still play audio anyway,1
Хайр,1
Puro ads nalang🤨,1
"30 secs level, 30 secs ad. Not playable",1
Suddenly stuck,1
"Holy Ads Batman! 30 seconds game play with 10-15 seconds after each round, good game but reduce the of Ads",1
to much adds i cant even play this game without getting an add i dont recommend,1
too many adds,1
Adds adds adds adds....scam,1
It was so laggy,1
"I appreciate that developers need to earn money, but more time watching adverts than playing the actual game doesn't do it for me.",1
King,1
Crash to much,1
Too many ads,1
"Adds, ads, ads and more ads. The game is extremely easy, every level and you watch more ads that you play. And they force you to do so.",1
Too many ads,1
"Bad game, more than enjoy it is annoying because of to many ads",1
It's very bad game,1
The ad's AFTER EACH LEVEL are 10x longer than the levels themselves. This is 100% garbage,1
An ad after every level. No thanks. Uninstalled.,1
Every level is too short and have too many ads.,1
Too Many Ad's!,1
Fn Adds are longer than the gameplay and are un skippable. Horrible.,1
Very poor and full of ads,1
Wants to take control of your phone,1
It's more ads than game Don't bother 10 second long levels with 30 second ads in between,1
"There are ADs after every level and they are long. Not worth this, uninstalled after three levels.",1
Bakwas game,1
"Play for 20 second, watch and ad, repeat",1
Garbage app. 3/4ths ads.,1
Full of add stay away from this game 🥵,1
This game is so bat in 2022,1
Time wasting money grabbing developers! A video add after every level? Don't be absurd this is ridiculous! Literally spending more time watching adds than playing!?!? Don't waste my time!,1
I give this a low rating. Reason being is because it's a rip off especially with the ads. it's fun but way to many ads buddy.!,1
"Too much ads has ruined the game , uninstalled",1
"Fun game, but WAY too many ads that run WAY too long. Will Uninstall. Let me know if you change this and I will reinstall.",1
Boring game,1
Bad game very very very very,1
Ads everytime when u win a game,1
"Designed to make you watch crypto ads. Boring gameplay where you move left and right. Doesn't get any harder. There's a base builder for no real reason. Every action requires you to watch ads. Complete a level, watch an ad. You unlocked a new skin, watch an ad. Want to change the colour of your little man, watch an ad. Good time killer if other options aren't available, such as pouring salt in your eyes or hitting your head repeatedly into a wall",1
This game is nice by that red colour change,1
Too too many ads.,1
Fat And dumb faaaaaaaaaæa tu aaaaaaaaaaaawaattttttttttttt,1
Too... many...ads...,1
بيض,1
Ad cancer game,1
WAY WAY WAY too many ads!,1
Boring and very repetitive with no real insensitive to want to keep playing not worth taking up my storage for a subpar game,1
If you like watching 90% adverts and 10% gameplay this is for you,1
Ad after every level what a nightmare Deserves 0 stars,1
"Fun, but way too many ads.",1
Jej,1
Play. Tons of ads. Play. More ads. Play. Ads..... Delete. Suuuuuuuuucks.,1
Way too many ads. You still get them even if you opt out of multiplying your rewards and move on. What is the purpose of accruing the diamonds? There is nothing in the game to spend them on...,1
Too many ads.. Everything you do is followed up by ads,1
A mindless playing experience which could be good for winding down but that's made impossible with the amount of ads every 30-40 seconds,1
Ad farm lol,1
"You play for 2 seconds, then 1 hour adverts :D",1
Too much advertisment,1
"Too easy (you literally can't lose), gets boring after 5 minutes and there's a bug where it adds up the wrong amount of things. It's literally the opposite of what a game should be",1
Super duper glitchy,1
Shite,1
The amount of ads...... its just awful.You spend 20 seconds on a level then a minute watching ads. I like the game. Its very good. But I deinstalled it after 48 hours. Its simply unplayable.,1
Way too many ads. Cool game. But levels are short and there is an ad after every level. 75 % of game is watching ad,1
Annoying game😠,1
"This game, while mildly entertaining, completely becomes unplayable after a few rounds. Every round is followed by an ad - you spend more time watching advertisements than playing. If the devs would chill on trying to cram as many ads into the game as possible, it might be worth playing.",1
More ads than game play,1
Kept downloading apps from ads without my permission.,1
"Riddled with advertisemen, levels are too short and after each level and ad plays. It feels like there is more ad time than play time",1
Bad game,1
Overkill on the adds,1
This is just an Ad generator. Don't bother playing. Even with wifi and data off it still loads ads.,1
"5 sec of play, 25 sec of ads. No ty",1
Sooooo many adverts that you can't enjoy the game. What's the point? Waste of time.,1
So many ads is coming after winning the game.,1
10 seconds of play and then a 30 second ad after each level. Pointless. Don't waste your time.,1
"Dogwater, please do not install, it's guaranteed that you will regret",1
Incorrect rewarded ads implementation. Admob account should be suspended for breaking policy.,1
TOO MANY ADS IT MAKES THE GAME LAGGY ANG BORING,1
More ad time than game time? I think this was created to trick you into watching an ad every 10 seconds. Unbelievable....,1
No it's so.so.so.bad,1
"Filled to the brim with ads. Terrible design, very good time waster if that's what you're looking for.",1
"Awful. The game might be ok, but it's buried in adverts. Just not worth the effort.",1
Awfull adware.,1
Adds after every click not enjoyable,1
Too many ads,1
This game is full of ads and it's obvious. The developers are so greedy.,1
Just one big ad. Not worth your time.,1
Annoying ads at EVERY LEVEL. Simple and Fun game.,1
The amount of adds is isane. At least give us the posibility to mute them. It keeks interrupring my music. Awful! I deleted the app.,1
Fix your bugs and glitches.. Full of ads,1
Way too many ads after each level. Very annoying!!! I can't enjoy the game as I would like. 1 star and deleted. Sorry,1
Levels only last about 20 seconds... and every level there's a 1 MIN add. DO THE MATH.,1
Reclame cu tona,1
"Ads every 30 seconds, literally!",1
Minute long unskippable ads between levels,1
Too pub,1
Forced ads,1
There's 10 second of game play to every minute of ads. There's a minute plus of ad time after every single level and the levels are 10 seconds long. It's ridiculous!!! Don't recommend this game it absolutely isn't worth it.,1
"this ads has a little bit of game, but its its good because it is also easy to uninstall",1
Ads ads.. for every single level. Too much of ads. Worst game 👎👎,1
Dhg,1
This is my first time trying this type of game and I have always avoided these types of games. I gave you 0 stars for a tired game. Don't try to download it. It has nothing to do with games. Just a stupid ad app. I feel sick after trying it,1
Way too many adverts for such a simple game.,1
I regret this,1
This game glitches and thats all i have to say about it,1
"Ive caught this game several times throwing the match just so I had to watch ads, even going so far as to freeze after a watched ad, be forced to watch another ad and still not receive the item promised for watching the ads. 1/10 would not recommend",1
Verry low frame rate and adds ever minute i dont recomend this,1
Ads ads ads. Can't even enjoy a level.. too many ads,1
Every button you press in this game seems to prompt you to watch an ad. Then there is an ad after almost every level. The game itself is a nice enough concept but each level is so short and repetitive that the game gets boring pretty fast. Overall just poor execution.,1
Too many ads,1
This is the worst game ever I recommend do not play this game it will only waste your data It gets impossible as soon u reached more levels,1
The ads are ridiculous,1
වැඩක්ම නෑ,1
It's mostly commercials. A few seconds of gameplay then 15-30 seconds of commercials. Find another game instead.,1
Cash grab app. Way too many ads. 10 seconds of game play followed by 30 seconds of ads. Literally every 10 seconds.,1
Ads,1
Ads after every round no thanks uninstalled,1
To many ad every level there is an ad,1
Too many ads.,1
Just ads,1
The ads are longer than the games,1
Ads ads ads ads ads ads ...,1
Căcatu puli mele,1
(DO NOT PLAY) It uses mobile data to play ads offline and the gameplay is terrible,1
"There is an ad after every time you finish a round, as others said you can turn off internet, but do you really need THAT many ads?",1
"What a joke!! Ads after every single round, sometime two in a row!!! You play 20 sec round and after that, ads!!! Uninstall this absurdity!!",1
Great add experience vs app experience,1
Ads The whole game is ads,1
Wow so many adds you for real guys,1
"To many ads waste of time , I played for 2 minutes and got rid of the app",1
"5 seconds of play, 35 seconds of ads. Not good.",1
Not sure,1
Add farm,1
"It gets boring, fast. It about as exciting as watching the ads.",1
so many ads to watch,1
"After every level 30 seconds adds,",1
It's designed so the levels are really easy so they can give you more ads,1
Hi friends This app is amazing and to brilint in this app,1
Worst game ever didnt even got to play to lvl 3 when it got really glitchy and laggy imediatly uninstalling it.,1
Toooooo mmmmaaannyyyy commercials,1
Every 5 seconds is an ad.,1
Insane amount of Ads!!!,1
Himanshu Kumsr,1
I hate it,1
Purposely meant to get less than a certain amount.,1
Too many ads...,1
30 seconds of advert for every 5 seconds of gameplay? Seriously?,1
Played its for 1 min and had 3 ads. Just ridiculous.,1
too many ads,1
Horrible to many ads,1
Very easy this game is.,1
"אין בעיה עם פרסומות במשחקים חינמיים, אבל למה בכל שלב לדחוף פרסומת שתיים? מה הגרידיות המחורבנת הזאת?",1
Too many ads.,1
To many freaking adds. After every level an ad. And a level takes like 10 seconds to play...,1
Far too many ads. After every go so ads around every 15 seconds. Would be fun if not so ad annoying,1
Ok game play but completely ruined by the excessive ads. Like constantly. Every level an unskippable 20-30 second add. I thought maybe if I turn on flight mode it could help but no. That game already has the adds built in and it ruins game play. Will be removing.,1
Ads ads and more ads. More ads than game. Installed. Played 2 levels and uninstalled. Ads.,1
This game is so boring I've been playing for a few weeks now and at the end it always makes you loose men so you cant get above x5.4 I realised that in the first game I played . I would NOT recommend people playing this as it's just a scam for you to keep playing it. I would play this game again if they made it so you cant loose half of your men at the end. Please make this game better then you will have lots of players.,1
I lag so hard,1
Very bad app,1
Only lasted about 5 minutes before uninstalling due to the bombardment of adverts.,1
Advertise to win,1
No audio. The game is too easy so that they can squeeze more ads in every 15 seconds or less.,1
"IN EVERY GAME, LADDER IT HAVE A AD THAT YOU HACE TO WATCH😠😡PLEASE FIX THESE IF I WERE TO RATE THIS I WILL RATE THIS -0 MY GHODDDDD😑🙄",1
"More advertisements than game time. There's an ad after each round, which is simply annoying. Otherwise a cool game.",1
Bored after 3 levels and the ads,1
"Ad bar ✔️, ad after every level ✔️, ad to unlock things ✔️, if you like watching ads and not playing, I have the perfect game for you",1
Too many ads,1
I hate this game i hate there ads just pick the good one,1
it has too much ads :(,1
Adds between adds,1
So many ads,1
"Lags, ad after every game",1
"Worst experience ever, 10 sec of playing then 30 of ads, absolutely disgusting",1
Just ad spam for days. Not a mobile game. Just a mobile ad machine.,1
My god I get it yes it's a free game...............but do you really need to out the adverts in after every bloody level..... its ridiculous 😒.,1
Terrible game.,1
Too many ads. Garbage.,1
All ads can't even play,1
A really fun game but the ads every 20 seconds ruined it for me.,1
Booring! You spend more time forced to watch ads then playing the game,1
This isn't a game it's an ad farm. There's no challenge to this game and there's at least one ad after every level. I understand needing to make money but this just irritates your player base. I uninstalled after only a few minutes because I was inundated with ads. I'll never understand a game that advertises other far superior games. It just leads your players to drop your game and install one of those.,1
Everytime you complete a round there's a ad awaiting for you. That's so irritating nd once you played you get bored after some time because evertime you played you feel like playing same round after and after. Disappointed,1
"Such a shame, too many ads. Instantly uninstalled it.",1
Why I'm sher my privacy,1
Another basic repetitive game thrown together as a way to make us watch advertisements. Dime a dozen and boring,1
Ff,1
The ads annoy me so much like just don't play this game it sucks I mean no wonder it had bad reviews it's awful it looked so fun in the ad but when you play it it's about 90% ads so this game is not good DO NOT PLAY!,1
"It's a money grab with microtrnasactions everywhere. Gameplay sucks and was probs coded in like 30 mins. But you know that, and just wanted to read reviews.",1
Enjoy some game with your ads the game is unplayable,1
ADS simulator. Don't waste your time,1
Never uninstalled a game so fast. Maybe don't sandwich your 15 second levels between 30 second ads that aren't skipable?,1
Disappointing,1
Too many ads,1
This game is very very waste game worst game and usless game😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
Ad! This game ads! sucks so bad. Ads! You get to ads! play for about ads! 5 to ads! 8 seconds ads! then you ads! have to ads! watch a 30 ads! second ads! to one minute ads!. ads! It's like ads! basic ads! math ads! for ads! 5-year-olds ads! . Ads! don't ads! install this ads! game ads! it ads! is ads! ridiculously ads! stupid. Ads! And that's what it's like ads! to play this game ads!. Ads!,1
I am gonna call you at a good online learner students,1
"Turn your phone's airplane mode on for ad-free gameplay and discover how meaninglessly generic this game really is! It does absolutely NOTHING unique and solely exists for the ""devs"" to farm ad revenue. Every 5 star review on this is fake. Don't waste your time or phone memory.",1
Far too many ads,1
Baddd,1
"Adware garbage, installed on accident and immediately regretted it.",1
Too many ads,1
My godd soo many adds🤬😡🤬,1
😎,1
Don't download this game. They make money strictly by making you watch ads. There was no effort put into this game whatsoever.,1
A lot of ads,1
Simply too many adverts. After each play fir heavens saje,1
Good game,1
I gets impossiple to play when you get too much people it lags and there is way too many ads,1
This game is ridiculous it portrays a cop a a boss you are supposed to beat.,1
Ad after ad...... It's more of a add play,1
Waaaay to many ads,1
Rubbish! It's not a game but an ads channel! There more ad viewing than gameplay! And there isn't a premium version to purchase to get rid of the ads. Real shame.,1
Love the idea 💡 but all levels are the same 😂 so boring I reached 899 level and it's the same with level one and super easy wasted time,1
"WAY TOO MANY ADS. DON'T DOWNLOAD. I'm sick of ""game"" companies with no passion that waste people's time with a laughable amount of ads. Companies like this give game developers a bad name.",1
I just started playing passed 2 levels and then then ads pop out. I tired of this BS.,1
Not godsaker pls delete,1
Be fun I there wasn't an ad after each level !!! And then no way to even pay for ad free. You play a level for like 20 seconds to then watch a 30 second ad... I'm watching more ads than getting to play the game! I uninstalled,1
"Avoid, doesn't give you rewards , makes u miss out but still gets an advert in so you get no reward but another dogshite game advert, get pen n paper n doodle, avoid this dogshite game ,",1
Ads are relentless. Makes the game virtually unplayable,1
"A full length advert after every round, bearing in mind the few rounds I played, each round was over quicker than the ad! I've uninstalled having spent more time looking at ads than playing!!",1
To many ads...,1
Boredom,1
More ads than anything,1
Ads for days,1
It could be a good game if there wasn't an insane amount of ads,1
Too many ads,1
Game is okay. But forces you to watch numerous adds in order to upgrade. And can't even use ingame currenc to progress. You MUST watch them. Really shady and quickly uninstalled,1
Adverts start to finish. Uninstalled,1
"There is an ad after everything you do. Don't want to upgrade? Watch an ad anyway. Just clicked off an ad but it lagged? Watch another ad. Literally the most annoying ads, too. Not interactive, and switches between like 3 different ads that you'll have memorized after playing this for like 5 minutes. I don't care about the OTHER games on this site, I wanted to play this one. But I can tell you more about the ad games than this one - given this one is just ""add bigger number to current number.""",1
"Handling is the worst imaginable. Sideshow rather than fluid gameplay. Completely randomised on the difficulty too. Zero stars. Also ofc ads everywhere, every 10 seconds.",1
To many ads,1
Too much advertising! Ugh,1
Laggy didnt even get thru 1 level I think it tried to show me 3 ads. Not sure cause it crashed each time,1
i downloaded the game to play it not to watch ads,1
"This is just a bunch of ads which are occasionally interrupted by a short, boring game.",1
It is an adware with a little of game!!,1
"This was one of the most rude things I had ever seen, in this app they show a camprshol for ""smart news "" When I press x to exit they download the app to my hone widout permission I the game is fine The rude thing that you did give you and smart news 1 star and if their is a button to complain about you bout I would",1
To many adverts not enough game,1
Ad infestation,1
You will not like it,1
"Unplayable, ads ads ads, greedy!",1
There is an add after everything you do,1
To many ads,1
"Terrible. Not only is this filled with numerous 30 second ads, when you have a character clearly dressed as law enforcement and the crowd gets to destroy him, I'm out.",1
Brutal amount of ads. Avoid it.,1
"Too many ads man, can't even play an entire minute without a 30 second ad",1
Not working properly,1
bad. game,1
😈😈😈😈😇😇 good morning my dear iyy,1
"If you like to watch an add every two minutes, thats the game for you",1
"Yet again, far too frequent ads. Players will continue playing if there were less ads instead of uninstalling after just two levels, and Devs would earn more. C'mon guys, get real.",1
Those 5 minutes were boringg this game is really boring since all you do is just choose choose choose i don't like it i deleted it after the 5 minutes,1
Too much ads,1
"Game levels aren't even as long as the ads, not worth it.",1
"Just an ad, ad, and ads,, nothing else",1
Ads are over zoomed so u can't do anything gotta close the game and return after every level .... this is a waste of time,1
Not like itttt yuck,1
Just ads,1
THAT BLOWS FAT COCK AND BALL,1
"Way too many ads. The game is fun, but you play a few seconds and have to watch ads for at least 30 seconds before getting to play again. Not worth it.",1
This game is so boring. The levels are repetitive and only take 15 seconds to complete then an ad after EVERY level. What's the point in the game,1
Game kept interrupting play to open a web page.,1
"Another game, with more adds than actual game play. I can't be a$$ed with these types of games anymore.",1
too many ads,1
ads ads ads ads its 20% game 80% ads,1
60 second add ever 20 seconds of gameplay,1
"Unfortunately, it's just another ""ad-grab"" game. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.",1
Keeps freezing useless app dont download,1
To much ADS .. ypu don't enjoy the game,1
Don't install this game 😤😤 👹👹,1
It's doo doo,1
"The amount of ads is extreme. The basis sounds fun, but the ads are way too kuch 10/10 if you like watching ads",1
So many adds,1
Great game but to many adds ruined it within a few goes for me. Fix and ill be back,1
Too many ads,1
Mediocre gameplay coupled with unskippable 30s ads every minute,1
Tujuan game ini ga ada,1
Too many ads,1
What were you thinking,1
Demasiados anuncios,1
Too many ads. WAY too many.,1
"I deleted this game after one go, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, not mention the game is rubbish",1
anuj jaat ................................................................,1
Can't get through a single level without ads sometimes multiple,1
To man ads,1
I like it,1
If you like a game where you have to spend ages watching ads then this is the game for you.,1
Ad fisher. 10 second playtime with 30 second unskippable ads after every level.,1
It makes my phone freeze when I open the app.,1
Too much advertising,1
Wayyyy too many ads.,1
"Too many forced ads (after every level), no option to remove ads with a paid version either. Also when you have a large group, it will pick up the wrong side as though you've walked through it for some reason.",1
Ad spam. Dont install. You will end up watching more ads for other games than actually playing this one,1
Add city,1
Too many adds,1
This game is a wast of time but it's okay,1
I've never played a game where 50% of your time is spent watching ads. Every level you complete (they take around 30s) you MUST watch a 30s ad. Less of a game more of just being forced to waste your time watching ads that don't benefit you in any way.,1
"Demasiados anuncios, horrible ..",1
Horrible experience with too many ads,1
Horrible ads never again,1
The game is too easy and theirs too many ads,1
Seriously what's with the adds??? About 30% gameplay and 70% adds. I know game developers need money and this game is free but the amount of adds on this is just greedy.,1
Too many ads,1
game literally so easy and it's just for money the devs are brats,1
The game is good but I played 10 levels with 11 ads. I understand free play for ads but this is to much.,1
"You should play this game only if you have approximately 3 working braincells in your brain. The game answers the fundamental scientific question: ""Wich number is larger - 60 or 5?"", a big hurdle for the great matematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. (By the way, this wonderful game is featured in the comedy ""Idiocracy"", 2006).",1
Too many adverts,1
"if you ever launched the game you know why it's 1 star, there's no need to comment on this level of bullcrap",1
"Played 3 levels and uninstalled, does it really need an ad break after playing one round ? Unbelievable.",1
Crazy amount of ads. Most of your time in the app is watching ads.,1
"More ads than game, would not recommend",1
The game was good but the constant ads ruined it.,1
Ads,1
Ad after every run? Uninstalled!!,1
"It is trash, +many ads",1
Worst game every,1
"An alright game, but having ads after every level is a no from me",1
"Playing this game is like beating your head into a brick wall repeatedly, except that that probably feels more rewarding. Zero difficulty, zero progression, zero effort.",1
Easy to play game which is rather enjoyable. Ad after every level is ridiculous though! Especially when the ad is longer than the actual level!,1
An already mediocre game ruined by the obscene amount of ads. No thought put into gameplay whatsoever: it's a money grab.,1
Could be a fun game to waste time on if not for the ads. I'd gladly pay a dollar or two to play an ad free version but that's not an option or is so hidden it's the holy grail. An ad after every single level is a guarantee and occasionally I've had one pop up in the middle of a level. You can't even trick it with airplane mode to get out of ads. Internet/data is required to play. I understand that developers and creators need income but this format makes the game unplayable.,1
I wish they could fit more ads in! Love that kind!!!!,1
Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. All the time. Ad.,1
"No Audio - Too Many Ads. Seriously, there's zero audio for me, until a trashy advert pops up, which happens after EVERY... SINGLE... LEVEL! DO NOT RECOMMEND!",1
Too many ads!!,1
"Way too many ads. 20 seconds of ads for each level. Not worth playing, so uninstalling",1
ITS SO BAAD TO MANY ADS I CANT EVEN HAVE MORE THAN 130 PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS CAUSE I WOULD PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE,1
Lag thats all bad game,1
Most trash game full of ads...GET THIS OFF THE STORE,1
Ads and once the map is done end of game,1
OMG the ads in this game are UNBELIEVABLY BAD!!! Literally after every single game a long ad comes on! AVOID THIS GAME,1
"Muito fácil, não teve piada 👎👎👎👎👎👎",1
"I agree with others. This game has an extreme amount of ads, way more than any other game that I have played. Game play is interesting, but it gets very annoying try to actually play.",1
ads game,1
Way too many ads.,1
Only completed level 1 and had 3 ads. If this is any sign not worth playing as you will spend most of your time watchis ads instead of actually playing the game. Sort it out or just take off play store,1
The ad was way different than the real game. Ads inside the game are too annoying. Not recommended at all.,1
Ads & ads & ads and even more ads,1
The game name should change from count master to ads master I can see only ads in every level .. this is sick,1
"Too many ads, can't unlock skins",1
Game se jyada to ad h isme,1
Game itself is meh. More ad time than actual play time makes it unplayable,1
just opend it 4 sec game play 30 sec add 2nd round same ....,1
To many ads like what the hell,1
Change your Ads for the App and maybe I would play it 🗣,1
"Interesting game, however, I'm watching more ads than playing.",1
"Absolutely garbage. Basically just ""which number is higher"" followed by ads.",1
Game is designed for the sole purpose of advertising. Oftentimes you will be given extra characters for the sole purpose of losing them with unavoidable traps. Don't bother with this at all.,1
"Trash. For each minute you play, you have to watck two minutes of ads. Levels are short and boring.",1
Repeatitive as hell.,1
Very bad,1
"I installed it bcause it looked interesting, but it is not a game, u playing 1 min, they give u 2 mins ads",1
Minute of playing 5 minutes of watching ads,1
Ads after every level. Really boring experience overall.,1
This game has add,1
Bad 😒,1
You'll down more time waiting on ads to finish than you do on each level.,1
It might be fun if every 20 seconds or so it was not showing an ad... Could not play for now than a few minutes...,1
This gam is so bad,1
It's a game of watching ads. You spend less time playing than watching forced ads.,1
You play for 10 seconds and then have to wait 45 seconds to to watch some adds. And this happens after every level. Too bad because the game looked fun. Uninstall!!!,1
It has sex adds,1
After every play an ad.,1
8 seconds of game play followed by a minute of ads,1
"Ads every level. Really? The game to ad ratio is about 60% playing to 40% watching. Yeah, watch me not uninstall.",1
"The game would be fine, but the ads are so agressive... It's disgusting.",1
Way to many adds that are way too long,1
Very bad dont installed this app,1
95% of the time you watching ads instead of playing,1
Just remove this advert posing as a game from your store...,1
Many ads! I deleted it!,1
Awful number of ads,1
"So many ads it feels like a virus. Any self respecting dev would never sell out like this. 20 sec rounds, an ad after every round that you have to skip 3 times. Shame on the devs, bunch of sell-outs",1
Literally unplayable with adds. Waste of storage,1
الى كل العرب نصيحة مني الكم لاتنزلوها مليانة اعلانات they're many adds in this game i can't play very well 😑😑😑,1
Ridiculous number of ads and too many of the unclear progress options give you even more ads.,1
It never gets more difficult. And the ads are so so ridiculously often!! Uninstalled Game,1
TOO MANY ANNOYING ADS,1
I spent more time waiting for ads than playing! Uninstalled in less than 5 minutes. 1/5,1
Full of ads..Time wasting game,1
Just ads nothing else,1
"Ridiculous , one level equal to watch one ad. Don't waste your time",1
To many adds there's literally one after every level. Don't waste your time,1
Very slow and glitchy,1
Do not download! ADs after every level!,1
Utter trash. Best avoided. Its mostly a scam to get you to buy currencies. A game only in the loosest sense.,1
Born game,1
Garbage adware,1
This game actually has potential to be fun. My only issue is there are ads every 30 seconds. Because that's how long the levels are. Super annoying.,1
Nothing but a way to give you an endless amount of adds,1
Very very happy with game 👍🏻👍🏻 game,1
A+ateh,1
Anouther fake pay to win game with truly endless adds. I played it for about 30 minutes and during that time watched about 20 minutes of adds. Shame on the devs. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!,1
adds,1
Every time the game end. Ads will pop up😒😤😡,1
"After 6 levels and 5 ridiculously long Ads in between the levels, I uninstalled the game. Pity, because it looked to be a fun game to play and I would like to have seen where it could have taken you to.",1
Publicidad y más publicodad,1
Worst app 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮,1
Developers are horrible and immoral. Installing this game will make you a bad person for contributing to their immoral empire.,1
Ad simmulator 🤮,1
"Ad spam after every game,just another cash grab move along",1
Them ads be having you fighting for your life,1
I hate adds!,1
Too many ads,1
"WAY too may ADVERTISEMENTS..the game turns into ""how fast can I close the ads down"" instead of actually playing. Yikes dudes....uninstalled.",1
This game lags too much,1
Shocking.. Ad played after each round.. Lost patience after 5th round.. Pointless downloading..,1
Ads factory,1
"It has ads after every level, it's stupid",1
To many ads,1
It's ads with a small game attached to it,1
Too many ads. Between every level and it just ruins immersion,1
"Could be a fun game, however this game is plagued with constant ads",1
Highs ki v the,1
"It doesn't contain ads, it is just ads. Every few seconds there is an ad. Disappointing.",1
Each round takes less time to play than the ad you are forced to watch runs. Why would anyone bother?,1
"It's fun, but the aggressive requirement to watch a ridiculous amount of ads (the kind with two or even three layers just to exit ONE ad, with very sneaky tactics to make finding the exit button really hard) to progress through the game or get diamonds or coins is absolutely ridiculous and completely kills it for me. Uninstalling after less than a half hour of installing.",1
Way too many ads. 15 secs of game 45 secs of ads. If i could give it zero i would.,1
Poo poo,1
Add simulator 3.0 do not install you will be watching ads more then playing the game. Played rounds last 15 seconds. Adds are 30-45. There is 2 adds per level. Absolutely disgusting,1
This game is best but the game is not not 3D the best so I got the answer count master crowd clash Stickman running game,1
It put 2 negatives so undlfaur,1
Too many ads,1
بد نی,1
It glitches too much and has wayyyyy to many adds,1
This app sucks. Once you get so far all it does is lag.,1
30 second non skipable ads after EVERY LEVEL this is barely a game more of a way for them to make money off ads.,1
"Normally don't mind the occasional ads, but the ads in this are longer than the actual levels !!!",1
"Only one method of thinking in this game, fun for 1 minute",1
Please 🙏 response,1
Theres just to many adds,1
stop with the trash,1
To meny add virts,1
"Ads are unbearable from download, made it to level 3 and uninstalled, sad, I actually thought the game looked fun",1
"Just as bad of a game as it looks, and before you ask yes I did beat the first level first try",1
On almost every tap it's an ad. Really disappointing as when you do get to play it's fun.,1
"Too easy, it was fun at first but this doesn't challenge you at all",1
Shocking ad after ad 12 seconds game play 20 to 30 second ad just shocking,1
Nothing but adds. I would pay for an add free version.but it isn't offered.,1
Boring,1
Boring and repetitive. Not sure how this made the top charts,1
Wish I could give negative stars,1
👎,1
Adds every level. Adds are longer than game play.,1
"A cool concept game, but you watch 2 minute ads after playing for 15 seconds, don't waste your time",1
Play for 10 seconds then watch a 30 sec add? Why bother making the game? I shouldn't have to turn on airplane mode.,1
So many ads...not worth it,1
The luck is bad,1
Way to many adverts,1
Ad after every level gets old,1
This game was fun and all but it had so many ads! The levels were so easy too! After every couple levels the screen went blank and wouldn't come back up so i had to close the screen and pull it back up. It was so annoying. 1 star because of all of these things. I do not recommend this game for anyone but it is your decision.,1
Another app designed for adverts not game play. Wouldnt bother.,1
One of the most ad infested games I ever played. The ads are so bad that I actually got farther in the playable ad demo for some Galaga clone then I did in the actual game. At least the ad had two different levels that were longer than in the actual game! Levels are 10 seconds long and then you get shown an ad even when you opt to skip! It's really bad people. Stay away!,1
Too many ads. Can't even play. What a joke.,1
You make it look so hard but no it's not so I'm not going to be in a relationship with the game and it's really easy to get me into the game,1
Each game play lasts 30 seconds or less. After EVERY one is an ad. So within 1 minutes 2 separate ads will pop up. Too many ads and not enough game play.,1
"This is a fin and entertaining game that is ruined by entirely...entirely too many ads, the last straw was an ad after declining an ad award, Uninstaller as a result",1
1 starts becuase cant give 2 stars ads after every touch of the screen play 1 10 sec level watch 3 min of ads,1
"it was okay but there are tons of ads. so uninstalled, sorry 😞",1
TOO MANY ADS,1
I give -2 stars to this game. To much ads come out after every minute. There no fun don't waste your time and mobile data.,1
"Ad bucket! I dont know how this made it to the top charts. While the initial levels are interesting, it does get monotonous. Ads will pop out between level, the time spent in rach level is considerably shorter than the ads. The x buttons on the ads are so small that it will force you to click the ads themselves. Don't download.",1
Game isn't to bad but the ads are ridiculous. I played for 10 mins before uninstalling due to the ads. Having to close app and restart just to skip an ad repeatedly is just plain annoying 🙄,1
Ads ads ads. After every single level there is a double layer ad that takes 15 - 20 seconds to get rid of. If you try to turn data or WiFi off then you can't play the game. I understand that money has to be made but this is pure greed from the developer.,1
Poo,1
"Pointless game, time waster, moreover, adds every 10 seconds",1
way way way to many ads carnt play the game for ads will uninstall it,1
Dont play. Too much ads. The game is nice but the ads will really really irritate u like hell.,1
This game stinks It gliches alot fix this game don't waste your time on this game I hope I helped,1
Not a good game never get more than 150 over line. And ads get more as hou progress.,1
15 sec of play 30 secs of adds,1
"Ad after every single play, not worth it",1
2 adds per level is hilariously greedy.,1
"Ads..,.. 🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇",1
Tooooooo many ads. Like way many,1
Play this game if you have an unrealistic desire for ads. The ads take longer time than finishing a level.,1
Ads,1
"This would be a good game if it weren't for the excessive amount of ads. Too many ads = To little fun = Uninstall. But I enjoy the game concept. You can have a great game with ads, but there is too many for this game to be bearable. Hopefully this changes.",1
More adds than game,1
To many ads!,1
Fun game but more ads than game play so it's pretty much pointless. You literally watch a longer ad than each level is every time you pass. Not even an option to pay to remove.,1
Just an Ad machine,1
It is trash,1
This game is hard to control,1
Since I didn't put 5 stars in the in-game review they didn't take me to the store to leave the review. Now you get a 1/5 for having no shame.,1
15 second levels that are kinda fun. But then long ads after every single level. Less ads or the ability to remove them and itd be fun. But absolutely unenjoyable with the ads.,1
i only got this gome becus i hate how dumb the people are in the ads,1
Too many ads 🙄😑😒😐😪😕🙄😑,1
Too many ads,1
My favorite game,1
Very bad game as it have limited level up and totally boring they use to pass as they want no matter how hard u goo.,1
"Ads after every single level? Nah, no thanks",1
"It's OK but the levels are so damn short and to be honest you spend more time watching ads than actually playing, also the ads for this game are retarded for example if there was a x100 or +1 they would choose +1 and to get skins and in game currency you have to watch ads. Don't play unless you want to milked for money",1
Too much ads,1
It is not had but it how out of the game every time,1
After installing the game i had ONE Ad for every ONE game played. Then I turned my WiFi off and played non stop without Ads for 15 minutes. Also the arrows are unavoidable,1
"This is a fun game, but had to uninstall there are way too many adverts you ca10nnot move to the next level without being shown an advert, when you have endured to watch the ad, some of the adverts do not give you an option to cancel once complete. Frastruating and 100٪ not worth it to keep this game.",1
Legit more ads thsn gameplay...,1
The game is only about luck on how the stage will be. The bonus stages are no bonuses at all. The camp with the Island and the boat that you invade the US with is not relevant to the actual game and does not help you to progress.,1
"game is fun, the fact that there's an ad every 10 seconds is laughable. too bad cause the actual game was fun",1
Too many ads! Unistalled immediately in 1st hour,1
It's fun but ad after beating every level and I mean it's an ad every 5 to 10 seconds since the levels are short not worth it,1
The adverts were sooooo long between rounfd,1
"Ads,ads,ads, I HATE it so much ADS do not download!!!",1
too many adverts,1
You'll spend more time watching ads than playing the actual game.,1
Way too many ads,1
"Too many ads. Levels go by so quickly, and there's an ad every single level with no end in sight. Almost every 30 seconds.",1
"Bad, glitch, so many adds",1
"Sorry. Seems fun, but way way too many adds. I have deleted it.",1
Ads ads ads,1
It crashes after only 4-5 seconds in the game.,1
"It's just an ad game, as everytime you finish the level...",1
To much lag,1
Cooooolyo macarena macarena,1
Bad,1
A typical clickbait game. Dumb and repetitive.,1
"Do you like ads? Wish you could waste your time to make someone else lots of money? Then download this! Also, how is this number 2 on ""Top free"". Have we just given up on mobile game design now?",1
BaD,1
Too much add,1
Don't,1
Boring and is riddled with adverts. I mean they disguise ads as part of the game so your clicking 'play game' and its an AD. Ridiculous and spammy. Uninstalled,1
A fun game if it wasn't ridiculous with ads,1
Do not download this game it is full of ads and full of nonsense,1
Boring,1
Adverts every 15 seconds that last a minute. Hilarious garbage for such a poorly made game. Cash grab programmed by a lazy idiot.,1
To many ads,1
Sales way to much of my info. Then makes it nearly impossible to opt out. Making you contact all the companies they sale your info to individually and each company has its own wild goose chase in order to opt out of saleing your info...,1
Each game is 10 seconds long and there's a 30 ad after every one of them. Also no way to pay for an ad free game. Maybe playable if your phone is on airplane mode.,1
Worst game ever.Actually not a game an advertising agency 😡😡😡😡,1
This is just an ad machine.,1
This is usually dispatched ad before it was not cool,1
"Obviously, this game is for one thing. To make money for whoever developed it. It's not meant for fun, or creativity. It's just for making them money. Don't waste your time.",1
Absolutely rubbish do not download 😭😤😡,1
Too many ads it's annoying after every damn level,1
"I conquered America but other than that it's boring. Wayyyyy too many adds. And if you choose to not watch an add it still gives you one, just shorter. Kinda weird that you conquer state adjecnt shapes in America. As the game goes on. The scoring system means nothing. And it doesn't matter how good you are it will force your numbers down based on level design. Overall it's a meh.",1
Ad player,1
"Poorly made. Completed the levels multiple times with 250+ guys and it seems like the game can't handle it. At the ending stairs, you can't see above 6.8x. Also, not optimized and after you've completed the island and bought all skins there's nothing left to do. And what's the point of putting boss every 3 levels if there's nothing more after beating them? The game could be cool with an infinite map. Also, lag issues above 300 guys.",1
Just an ad revenue bot. Not worth the time.,1
"Downloaded and played first 3 levels, face with an ad after every level. Uninstalled.",1
Ewwww the ads.,1
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🙏😣😣😣😣😣😣🙏😣😣😣😣😣😖😖😖😧,1
All adds all the time,1
"All the app is Ads, very poor!!! I hate the ads on it",1
It's huge,1
"Just one of many mind numbing programs with barely any actual game, used only to shovel ads into your face.",1
Really boring game. Even when you get to play a little between all the ads it's not fun. No sound as well. It's only purpose is to make you watch ads,1
"ABUSIVE WITH ADS Decent brainless, time filler. HOWEVER...and this is not an exaggeration. Every level plays AT LEAST one ad between levels. Most levels play 2 ads. If they offer a 3rd or 4th ad for extra prizes, and you tap ""No thanks"" or ""Skip"", they still play the ad anyway and you just don't get whatever extra reward was offered. For free games, it is acceptable to show 1 ad for every 5 levels, especially when the levels are less than 30 seconds each. But 2 or more per level? RIDICULOUS",1
To many ads,1
This makes no sense,1
U spend more time clicking through ads than playing the which is ridiculously easy.,1
complete garbage in the form of an app,1
"An absolute waste, 💯 waste. It will send you messages even at midnight when you are sleeping. Make sure your phone is muted before sleeping, if you want to install it 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
idiot game,1
amazing game,1
Way too many ads Watch more ads than actually playing the game.,1
"It was a good game at the start but then it just began with a lot of ads. If there were not so many ads all the time then it would be great. So maybe try to make it so you only see an ad for every 3rd level you play or something like that cuz you already have the ""see an ad to upgrade"" and that is already too much. Slot of of these comments are bots so remember to look out for that other people.",1
"The ads is more longer than the playing the game :> Everytime you finished the run theres the ADSS :> THEN THE ADS IS 30 seconds plus 5 seconds before u can skipp :> this game Sucksss everything is about adss spin wheel ,collect skin etc adsss adss adss adss",1
Its bad,1
"You can effect the outcome slightly, it's set in stone",1
Waaaaay to many ads. Each level takes about 30 seconds and an ad plays after each.,1
"Aggressive ads, without option to buy game",1
This game is bad is way too easy. Their is no challenge all you do is run you can't avoid anything this game made me tired in 4th level. This game is so boring and bad,1
"Dull, dull, and thrice dull. There is no progression in the game it is just level after level after level of exactly the same, there is no difference between a spike, a hole or a spinning blade.",1
Way too repetitive nothing changes but your money colour and shape,1
"For every game, expect to see 3 adds. One before you start, one to get more starting guys and one at the end to get your reward.",1
ilove tis game,1
Ads after every run. Runs last less than a minute...,1
I think there might be a game in all your ads,1
Ad after every level. Do better.,1
"Seriously, the number of ads! You get to play for about 15 seconds, then you have to sit through at least 15 seconds of ads! The reviews are not exaggerating!",1
"Adverts last longer than the game, complete and utter ****! Don't waste your time.",1
"Punish player by using non-movable group, even though we are trying our best to maximize the number. not to mention the brain-dead ad that I keep seeing over and over again. 1/10 playable,",1
"Unplayable, level, ad, level, ad, level, ad... repeat",1
Too many ads,1
Ads are way too long.,1
Ad's large amount,1
Game might be very interesting but long ads ruined all the fun. Install only if you have extreme patience.,1
Genuinely the worst gaming experience ever. The amount of ads is unacceptable.,1
There are more ads than game play.,1
It's boring,1
12 ads per level,1
Don’t waste time and mb Too much ad.,1
Waaaaayy too many ads. Uninstalled after 5 mins,1
Adverts last longer than the levels!,1
Ads after every level. Mind numbing simple level of play,1
What we are supposed to do with those diamonds??,1
ads every 10 seconds,1
You mostly watch ads. Very disappointed,1
This game,1
"Horribly overcrowded with adverts. Do NOT download this game. when you just want to play the game an ad pops up and it is the same stupid old and again and again and, you guessed it, again.",1
"What is it with all those ads, so annoying, removed",1
Soo cheesey,1
To many adds,1
"Add after every level. Really loud adds as well, uninstaled.",1
IS A GAME HORRIBLE GAME ONLY ADDS i not recommed at all,1
More adds than game play. Very annoying. Uninstalled.,1
"Everytime there is an add after every level, you can't get out of it and it always takes you to the play store to install the advertised game. So you have to shut down the app completely to get out of it. There is no skip add or x to close the add. Not going to do that over and over. Don't install.",1
Awful amount of ads every 20 seconds after a game. I would even say you spend more time watching ads then playing the game,1
More ads than playing.,1
wow sure you ar a nerds if you want to install this,1
Way too many ads,1
too many ads,1
Ads ads ads,1
Every level last about 10 seconds and there is an ad after every single one plus ads in-between every now and then. It's so unbearable,1
Ad after ad after ad. Unplayable.,1
Uninstalled it after level 2. It's an ad app with occasional interruptions for brief game play.,1
Trash,1
the game can be fun but there are really too much ads!,1
Won't let you play well because of the adds. Uninstalled,1
This app should be called advert master because its a useless game,1
Add city no content,1
I will give It one star I really didn't like this game,1
"Each level takes about 15 seconds, then you have to watch 2 minutes of adds to play for another 15 seconds. Absolute trash.",1
SO. MANY. ADDS.,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads. A full length ad after every level.,1
I would rate higher if the game play equaled more time than ads. I played 4 levels which are maybe 10 to 15 seconds long. Had an ad after each one being at least 30 seconds.,1
"Ads, blech",1
"Okay game. I'm okay with ads, but the amount of ads is crazy. To even breathe I need to watch an ad.",1
"Waaaaayyyyyy too many ads it's ridiculous, plus you'd have to be a simpleton to find this challenging",1
Too many ads,1
Feels like I instaled adds with a option of playing a game,1
Advertising after every level is stupid and annoying,1
More apps than playing game,1
Lots of ads. No game play,1
"Honestly, no level is the same even if you repeated them, and its just an AD farm.",1
Too many ads,1
"Ads are excessive and lengthy. Short 10 seconds runs of a game, ago ads minimum 20 seconds. Some need 3 confirmation you don't want whatever they advertise. Uninstall.",1
"I timed how long you get to play vs how long it shows you adds. 20 seconds of play, 20-30 seconds of adds",1
Tatty hai,1
Honestly the only reason you got this game was because of their boring advertisement that always got it wrong. You got it to prove how you could do better. The only purpose this game serves is to show you a ton of ads for other games that you just get annoyed with the same way you did the ad for this one. It's seriously not worth the hassle of installing to your phone. Save yourself the trouble.,1
Ahhh,1
Ad.ad.ad.ad.a D.a.d..a..d.a..d..a..d.a..d..a..d.a..d.s..f always AD,1
Ad after ad.,1
Rip off amogus charater was the only good part of the game,1
The amount of ads. These people are why I stop checking it new stuff,1
the amount of adds is abusive and makes it unplayable,1
Ads and ads and more ads,1
"Way to many ads, come on guys, chill on the ads, I understand that's how you make money but it's more ads then playing by far!",1
Skip this ad,1
Good game but the constant ads are so frustrating 😑 😒 😤,1
Full blown 30 second unskippable ads after every round,1
"Ridiculous long commercials that blast volume, unskipable. Uninstalled",1
"This game is so annoying. Every time I want to move, it won't let me. Also, I think the upgrades are too expensive.",1
"The ad for their app asks you to play ""drag to move"" but when you touch the screen it takes you to the shop immediately, if they're dishonest about that what else are they being dishonest about?",1
It's annoying with a lot of ads and u can't play with long ads don't recommend it at all 8 joke the makers change this stubid way to collect money I ll tell my friends on about bad experience with app.,1
"Having to watch an Ad after every game, nope. Count me out",1
Ad after every level...also important to note that the ad plays longer than the level takes to beat.,1
Love it and I hate it at the same time😊😒😒😒😒,1
Way too many ads.,1
Too much ads. Removed.,1
Plays like it looks: A playable ad. Now with 100% more ads.,1
in fact it is some ads that sometimes let you play game between them😑😐,1
Constant ads. Multiple ads too,1
"Ads come after literally every single level, from the first to your last",1
"Ads ruin this game ..I played one game . .I couldn't even finish it because of the ads. I watched two ads to get free bomb type blocks then they give you an option to not watch the ad for free stuff and you still have to watch the ad, you just don't get the bonus .. could have been a cool waste of time game but, the ads made this an instant uninstall .. waste of time more ads than game play.",1
Its more ads then acctual gamming,1
Too many ads that pop up every 30 seconds,1
More ads then the actual game,1
Way to many ads,1
Way too many ads,1
This game is so laggy I just got it and it wasn't even working this is the most laggy game I've ever played,1
worst,1
Ad every level.. not a game just a money maker..,1
"Ads, ads and ads",1
An advertisement during the first level? This is trash,1
Far more time showing adverts than game play. Rubbish,1
Ads - Ads - Ads and more Ads. I can't stand games like this. Every time you play you have to watch an ad. Sucks.,1
Too many ads🤦‍♀️,1
I'm playing more ads than playing the game itself. Smh.,1
No debile 1 gwiazdka bo jak wgrałem gre to update,1
10 sec play and the a minute of ads. Waste of time.,1
It's a sad game because of the amount of ads for it. Everything you do requires you to watch a 1-3 minute ad.,1
It is so slow to download 😭😭,1
Ads after every single round that turns off my background music or videos. No thanks,1
This game sucks anymore it cheats and is always freezing up since the update I'm uninstalling,1
"I had a playable ad for this game in this game. The game I was playing was advertised to me inside the same game. In that ad I could basically play the entirety of the game. In the ad. Also, the ad time to play time is about 3:1. I wish I would have stuck to playing it in an ad and not wasted my time installing it.",1
"10 seconds of gameplay, 2 minutes of ads",1
"Ads after every round. This ""game"" is purely an ad revenue machine. Avoid at all costs",1
Repeats the same levels over and over,1
To many ads. Uninstalled,1
Great game for 5 minutes then you just can't handle the advertisements. Whoever setup an ad every level should be shot.,1
"Haha yeah no... 10 seconds of playing, 30 seconds ads... I don't think it's about money anymore, this is some kind of test to find out how much stupidity people can endure... This ad-simulator is the worst...",1
Ad simulator,1
WAY WAY WAY TOO MANY ADS,1
fuke,1
"WAY too many ads! The last straw was an ad that ran right in the middle of a level. Time to give up and uninstall. On the plus side, it's a cute, fun game. It's a shame that it's so ad heavy.",1
Game jams wen i get alot of ppl,1
"5 second level followed by 30 second advert, rinse and repeat.",1
ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS😡😡😡😡😡SUCH AN ANNOYING GAME,1
Good game put off by ads after every single level plus you can't skip them,1
To many adds good idea I can't do the adds,1
"Game is full of ads. There are forced ads between levels and the levels are very short. There doesn't seem to be any sort of level design, it's just random obstacles thrown in there. I'm guessing it has taken at most a few hours to put this get together from elements the developer already had lying around.",1
Installed and was immediately assaulted by ad after ad for literally every function. No thank you.,1
Terrible. Ads every 7 seconds. Extremely frustrating.,1
To be honest there are a bit too many ads in this game 😂,1
Too many ads,1
Every 2 sec an add. Seriously f off!!!,1
ads ruin it,1
It's just ads v little game,1
"Typical mobile game, too many ads",1
"You think by the video it be a good game but it's not, there's a lot of ads in it.",1
Very bad,1
"Ads Ads Ads, an easily programmed game designed to make you watch ads at every level, in fact, you watch ads more than actually playing. Ridiculous.",1
Laggy and full of ads,1
"Even without the ads, this game is pretty garbage. Not sure why it's the number one game, I suspect fake installs.",1
Too many ads,1
This game is good but when I play in my iPhone it says your phone has no space,1
Way too many ads,1
"5 seconds boring game after every 30 seconds ads, wasted",1
Not so good...😢😢😢,1
Too many adds,1
"Unplayable due to ads. Seriously, more adds than game, and they can take 3 presses of tony buttons to skip. Going to find a clone with less adds.",1
"After every level you are ""forced"" to see an adv. I don't recommend!",1
Too many ads,1
There's 20 seconds of ads to 7 seconds of play. You can't buy ad free. I wouldn't anyway though. You'd need the iq of a termite to find it challenging. Don't waste your time.,1
"Don't download this game!! And if you do, definitely read the privacy policy before agreeing!!",1
salmn salmj eghrd,1
Wow Omazing Hi Hahahahaha,1
Too many ads,1
5 minutes of ads for everyminutes you play. Fun concept but for the amount of ads .. no thanks.,1
It sucks I once had 200 hundred people but then it LAGGED and I was now at 37 people I was happy it was at 200 people because at level 30 or higher I end it at like 70 people nut after it lagged my hole phone was lagging so this sucks I wish I could rate it 0 stars,1
This is the worst game. It contains lots of ads and due to this device had lots of glitch,1
Too many ads. Combat encounters are extremely laggy.,1
Bad game,1
waaay too many ads,1
Your stupid game keeps on lagging where I reach more than 200-300 troops. And that spell loosing a level.,1
No point in playing the game,1
Its basically an ad viewing app and not a game.,1
Play if you wanna make the developers money by watching ads,1
Too bad.. after every level showing ads.. its too much ads😠😠😠,1
This game actually sucks it's very laggy and adds another of adds I can't even play it the game is so lag it made the red giant hammer guy just swiping none stop,1
totally good game,1
ITS TOO EASY TO GET TO THE END,1
Now I remember why I uninstalled this ads after every level and the adds are longer than the levels,1
خیلی بده چون همش میبری,1
Okay ! I like it but theres so much ads and its so confusing this app is so bad sry bc about the ads i get off the wifi but when i play its really gd but when im attaking at this red guy and hes stop attaking my grp and my grp run and still on the same place its so bad fix this If u fix this maybe i well rated for 5 stars all the ppl talking really true fix thisss uhh,1
"Poor, some many ads and such little gameplay.",1
Ads! Why so many? And why are the games so short? You could have each level last longer by letting us play until we fail! 1 tap on anything and your facing 30 second ads!!,1
IT LAGS AND PLS FIX THAT,1
"More advertising than gameplay, every time I finish a 10-15 second level, I get 20-30 seconds of unskippable ads. Sorry I understand the need for ads, but the ratio should at least be 1:3 ads:gameplay if not better.",1
The game always glitches when i reach more then 200 players and when i jump with the 200 players they end up to 24 left and when i reach the obstacles while i am 200 players they don't move where i want them to move,1
"Horrible, too many ads",1
Played the first level that took about 10 seconds and then I was shown an ad right after. I uninstalled since I could tell it was going to be one of those games where you spend more time watching ads than actually playing.,1
"Ad simulator... Level is 15sec, ads after level are 30sec...",1
Terrible. You watch the ads more than you play the game.,1
moslék,1
This game is very nice,1
Worst!,1
It lags way too much. Uninstalling,1
"So. Many. Ads. Play for 30 seconds? AD. Upgrade after match? AD. Build kingdom? AD. I wouldn't be surprised if there was more Ad time than game time. The game itself is kinda fun, but it's not fun enough to endure through that quantity of ads. Ridiculous.",1
"Rubbish game, after every single level you are forced to watch ads which are longer than the actual level you're playing.",1
This is good 👍 game,1
I tolerate adverts but this is ridiculous!,1
"Ads, ads & more ads, come on! , Boring gameplay, and ruined by ads after every turn. Typical of most stupid games on Android these days.",1
Unplayable because of ads,1
Constant adds,1
1 AD on every level??? Really!! @Google ban people like r hus!!,1
Suck,1
"So. Many. Ads. Ads after every level. Ads to collect loot. Ads when switching between screens. I sat through 10 minutes of Ads for approx 2 minutes of actual game play. An option to purchase a ""No ads"" add-on would go a long way toward a higher rating for me.",1
"Seems like fun, but an ad after every level is beyond ridiculous. Instant delete.",1
"This game is a fun concept, but the constant ads make it nearly possible to enjoy.",1
Pis,1
Its good but I keep dying. So if you dont wanna die then download Sonic.,1
"Too much ads. Everytime you finish a level, there's an ad. Can't be bothered. Kick the buddy would be better.",1
To many ads,1
There are way too many ads and the levels are too short. Not worth downloading unless you just want to waste time.,1
So glitchy 🤦,1
The reviews are true . . .,1
Ad every 15 seconds. Can fully beat it in under an hour.,1
This made me delete 2 of my games and then it doesnt wanna download I kept pressing it more 10 time It's really pissing me off right now,1
Too many ads,1
اللعبة مليءة بالاعلانات,1
Too many in game ads.,1
Too many ads,1
To many advert 🤯,1
Trash game it's not good at all do NOT recommend downloading to many ads it's also not a fun game in any way,1
"Terrible money grabbing scheme, just what I was expecting more ads than game and atrocious gameplay.",1
"Very bad game, has so many ads level by level, dont recommend, hot garbage.",1
Boss doesn't die when 0 health,1
Far too many adverts. Its Unplayable,1
It's just one big long interactive ad. I would not call this a game.,1
"Rubbish game, only got it cause I kept getting shown ads of it and had to try it at least. But, like every one of this developer's games, it is rubbish.",1
Bad its boring,1
Too many ads.......,1
"Cute idea, but the amount of ads is horrible. 10-20 seconds level, and then 30-55 seconds of ads. Never mind the 3 x 30 s when you open the boxes. I'll uninstall it now, absolutely horrible",1
Too much adds,1
Advertising should have a limit. I played game 30 mins 25 mins is advertisement,1
The amount of ads is ridiculous.,1
"Only a few levels in and ads between each level, this isn't a game",1
To many ads.,1
"Unless you are willing to spend real money, then this game isn't worth your time. You will spend more time watching ads then actually playing the game",1
Abusive frequency of ads,1
Horrible,1
"The game is ok, but tooo much ads... after every level I must watch 1minutes ads....shame",1
Ads after every finished stage.,1
Why do we still settle for these games that force ads on you. We r in charge. Don't play their games if they do this. Take back the power. I say to hell with game and all others like it,1
It is bad,1
Ad-ridden game,1
"Too much adds , very annoying",1
Would rate negative stars if I could! I Uninstall every game that has an ad after every 10 seconds of use. Beware this one not only throws ads like crazy but they're 90 percent 3 step ads(3 ads in one ad),1
Horrible piece of trash! Basically like 99% mobile games now it too is an advest sim. Avoid at all costs!,1
NOT EXAGGERATING. ADS EVERY 10 TO 15 SECONDS!! HORRIBLE,1
Anything that has forced ads is one star,1
Ads,1
Ads ads afs...,1
Boring,1
Nihal ansri,1
Finish a 5 second level? Watch this 30sec add. Want to change your color? 30sec add. Level up? Want your rewards? 30sec add. Want to build a building to progress? 30sec add. It's a shame because it looks really fun and good little math refresher. But can barely play.,1
Add's are too much,1
Ads every 30 seconds,1
I liked the game a lot. Unfortunately there's so many ads I am uninstalling it. But the game is really interesting to play. If you actually get to play.,1
Full of ads!!!,1
"Game is ok but you get an add after each 15 second level. More watching adds than actually playing. Almost forgot to mention that when you are playing, there is a footer.... with a add....",1
Nothing to say.,1
Too many adds. Deleted before hitting level 3,1
Glitches and lags way too much. Also ads galore. Uninstalled after 5 minutes of play.,1
Nothing but ads you can't even close sometimes. Not worth it,1
More Ads then game,1
Don't bother. No way to skip 45 second ads. Not worth it.,1
Length of adverts is far too long compared to each level. The balance of the game is ruined.,1
"So many ads, just call it ad simulator.",1
"Too many ads! If you like ads, download this game. I'm warning you this might be one of the worst games ever!",1
Nice game,1
"Great ads, had lot of fun with them! Also, there is boring game included, but most of the time ads are saving the experience. Thanks!",1
মিনা,1
Intrusive advertising,1
"Play 4 levels get 5 ads, way too much!",1
There is zero challenge at all to this game. It's simply time wasted.,1
Too many ads which is annoying and this game is very easy. So if you wanna save your nerves and wanna play in this game turn of your wifi or internet,1
Too many adverts,1
Bad bad bad . Every ten second level then has a 1 min + add after it . Pure joke . Don't do it trust,1
"Ads after 30 seconds of using, worst ever",1
The way the it is made it's like you can't ever get to the top of the stair thing's and get boring after a while,1
Game crashed at level 5 smh,1
Pathetic Full of Ads,1
This is an ad trap. I spent more time being forced to watch ads than playing this game in the first 5 minutes. Deleted it from my phone less than 10 minutes after installing it.,1
"It's a great advertising platform, but little else... Would have been somewhat enjoyable if each part between adverts (""the game"") was more than a couple of seconds long",1
"Too many adds... it's impossible to play the game, you spend more time watching adds than actually playing",1
Super annoying. It's an ads network that has a little tiny simple game inside. it shows you 30 second of ads in every second of game playing. 👎👎👎👎👎,1
Levels too short and adverts inbetween levels are VERY long!,1
It was aful on tablet so glitchie and you cant move i dont recemened if you are on a samsung tablet i rate one star because it just wasnet as good as a game as i wanted it just wasent a good game glitchie and bad if you like glitch and frozen screen then go ahead if not stay away game bad but only for tablet phone idk so at your own risk for phone,1
Browser of forced ads.,1
Too many ads,1
Bu oyunda islamofobi var,1
"Ads take way too long to play, longer than the levels",1
Too glitchy on level five,1
Too many advertisements to enjoy the game!,1
App sucks stop adds plz plz plz plz stop the adds,1
Horrible Game! Any game that has you gang up and kill Cops is not a game to will last smh! Shame on you!!!!,1
Even if you put your aeroplane mode on so you don't get ads the game is far to easy got to level 60 without loosing a life shambles,1
Too many ads,1
Cant delete it,1
"Excellent advert app, you also sometimes get to play the game.",1
Its not downloading what the hell is it......stupid app worest app...don't download it net weast....,1
It's a boring game,1
Game has potential to be fun but its rigged with non stop ads and the levels are so short. Very bad.,1
Boring not so good,1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS RUBBISH.SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S ADVICE .,1
Fun game. Well designed. Addictive. Well done. However the adds are way to intrusive and frequent. I also suspect foul play as I'm assuming you get paid per click and even when I click the x button to exit I end up at a download page. So I hope this review is historical evidence that you knew about this.,1
Ads unbearable - non stop ads. Not worth it,1
"Too many ads, lags too much.",1
Too much ads every level there is a ad im dissapointed im also unistalling,1
This game is just as bad as you thought when you saw the ad.,1
Too long ads while playing game,1
"GREAT game, DON'T NEED ADS BETWEEN EVERY LEVEL 🤬",1
Could have been good but the developer decided to ram ALL the ads down your throat. Uninstalled.,1
Too many ads,1
Long ads every 30 seconds of game play,1
Too many ads,1
This game is kinda fun but there are lots of ads and the ads are even longer than the rounds so I don't recommend this game,1
Too many ads,1
Can we have a 0 star? Because we are wasting our time playing. Every seconds the ads will come out hahahah delete this app its not entertaining.,1
teribble so much asds a waste of time,1
20 seconds of game play and then 30 seconds of ads. No thanks.,1
Adverts are ridiculous.,1
I'don' like it,1
Your game is very good but the worst thing is that the huge amount of advertisement you give it destroys the mentality of playing the game so I deleted it. It is so annoying not to play the game.,1
Worst game,1
"Played 3 levels, ads are longer than the levels. Uninstalled.",1
"Too many ads, not enjoyable at all",1
"The ridiculous amount of adverts in this game makes it unenjoyable. By time you realise how repetative, unchallenging and plain boring the game actually is, you've already uninstalled it as you noticed you've watched more ads than actual game time.",1
Ads! Ads! Ads!,1
"Too much add, hang issue",1
"You barely get to play the game because there is an advert every 5 seconds, don't even bother.",1
Awful.,1
"One of the evil bosses to be defeated is represented as a police officer. Thanks but no thanks, uninstalled.",1
There's a game in this ad.,1
"Not a very fun game. I got to the 3rd level where the first ""boss"" was. I had so many against him that it lagged the whole game for 10 minutes. Also, you can't control the group very easily. And it's kinda stupid that you have to let some walk right into the hazards even when trying to avoid them. And the ads are very annoying as well and happen after every level.",1
It sucks,1
Tons of ads,1
Too much ads.,1
"Ads Ads Ads. More ads than game play time. Between every level, there is double the time it took to complete the level - in ads! Everything and anything you do with the game, you're forced to watch ads. What a horrible game",1
Too many extremely annoying ads,1
Very poor game .not working Well.dont download anyone,1
Too many ads and after a while it gets boring since it the levels dont get harder and in some cases you cant even achive new hights it is also very laggy,1
worst game ever like make new game bro like areyou serious man find new games bro ur games trash bro like make new games noobie make new game i hate this game deleat all the games you made >:( !,1
Too many adds makes this game very boring.,1
The ads are actually horrible. Don't even bother,1
This game is okay at best. It's practically nothing but ads. If you love watching ads and taking a break every now and then to play a game this is the app for you,1
Ads. Ads. And ads.,1
"This game looked simple enough, so I decided to try it out. This game is BOMBARDED with ads. Finish a level, here's an ad, then right after, wanna upgrade your guys? Here's an unskippable ad. Finish the next level, another ad. Oh, you unlocked a new skin at the end of this level, have another 30s ad. Then upgrade your guys right after, ANOTHER 30s ad. The levels take 15-20s tops to complete then you are watching 45-75 seconds of ads. I WILL be uninstalling and do NOT recommend this for anyone.",1
Full with ads,1
"Was ok for 10 minutes, before I realised it's pretty similar levels, and an advert after every level Is annoying.deleted it.",1
"This is an ad collection, not a game...",1
WatseWatse,1
THIS GAME IS NOT A GAME ITS ADS SO MANY ADS I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS I HATE ADS AND I WOULD RATE IT 5 STAR IF LESS ADS 😔😔😑 REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE,1
"Ad vs gameplay is terrible. Play a 10 second level, forced to watch a 15-30 second ad. This is every single level.",1
Unable to play,1
Too many adverts,1
Terrible,1
Well that was fun for 5 minutes to bad it's just an add,1
"Would be a good game to unwind with, but the excessive use of adverts between every single level ruins it. Got fed up after less than 10 minutes. Now uninstalling.",1
"This is not a game with a lot of advertisements, this a library of advertisements with a playable game in between videos. The advertisements are not skippable and must be watched. It is mandatory to watch one to play the next level. When you collect enough tokens to get a new skin, it is mandatory to watch an advertisement to unlock the skin, then you have to pay the in game currency to acquire the skin. Then it is mandatory to watch another advertisement after you aquire the skin.",1
Why do I keep freezing? I JUST installed this and the ads and it just freezes is absurd! Seems to maybe be a decent game if this didn't happen...,1
Full of ads,1
"10 seconds of play, 30 seconds of adverts. No option to remove said adverts. Uninstall. Don't waste my time.",1
This game looked promising but it's too simple. Also too many ads.,1
Way too many advertisements,1
Advert after every level... Enough said,1
Ad ad ad,1
Way too many adds and you lose most of your men before you get to the end. some fall off the edge and some Obstacles you cant avoid. Uninstall,1
It is more platform for adds then a game.,1
Gameplay very easy and fast. Ads after every level -> you will watch ads most of the time instead of playing the actual game. Nice Idea but way to many ads ...,1
Highly repetitive and constant ads.,1
To many adds. Game tells you the best path when attacking so there's no thought involved,1
Stupidest game ever! Not even worth installing do many ads WOULDN'T RECOMMEND👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿,1
Ads ads ads. Scumbag devs looking to make money only instead of having a quality user experience.,1
Excessive ads. Makes it boring to play even though the gameplay is good the ads make you uninstall it.,1
The are so much so please fix it,1
You can't play too many adds . Not worth the trouble.,1
Aoa,1
The ads were longer than the game play,1
It is rubbish because it doesn't want to install in my phone so no stars,1
"I dont know whats wrong with this game, but there is something wrong with it",1
Too much ads...,1
"This game is so bad. It almost destroyed my phone, whenever i have 150 characters the game is lagging like crazy",1
Too many ads,1
Too much ads,1
Come on now everytime you play a game your hit with an add afterwards??? This is horrible & way to short ta keep getting ads...Games are smothered with so many darn ads who wants to even be bothered...Uninstald after 3 minutes 🙄,1
10 minutes of game to 60 minutes of ads. Guess that isnthe real part ofbthis being a math game.,1
Pointless and ad-ridden Very quickly run out of reasons to play and collect diamonds or cash. It's even pointless going on raids. Too many damned ads.,1
"Boring. The most exciting part of this game is ads, which I guess is good, given that is where you're spending 2/3 your time.",1
Boring not woryh d time,1
"I legitimately watched so many ads in a row that at some point, I complely forgot what game I was playing. 10/10 would install again.",1
Ads every 10 seconds and passive ads,1
"The ads made to show this game actually sucks, it's so annoying and puts me off, if the actually played it properly I'd give it a chance but looks like I won't since the ad put me off. What's worse is that the game has little to no challenging aspects to it",1
15 seconds of gameplay between each ad. I wish I was exaggerating.,1
Not a fun game. Way too easy. It also has an absurd amount of ads in it. You spend more time watching ads then you do actually playing the game.,1
Soo many repetitive adds,1
More advert than game,1
"Too many ads, non-challenging gameplay",1
Take your ads and kill yourself with it. This game is a waste of time every play ad opens even offline mode,1
Ads magazin ! This is made only for watching ads !,1
Ad after every level. You literally spend more more time watching ads than playing the actual game.,1
Adds are WAY!! TO PERVERTED!!! on this game,1
Trashc,1
Etwydsv,1
I hate ads,1
This is just a ediot and ediot game no Fun game 🤯☹️,1
"It's that kind of game just for chill, extremely easy to get the rewards, but the RIDICULOUS amount of adds are annoying",1
Ad ad ad no ad,1
Worst game ever there advertising every round you play. It a waste to watch this ads. Would not recommend play this play.,1
"Fun game, but the constant adds are extreamly frustrating and I will not continue playing the game because of it.",1
"The game itself is a fun experience, but the 30 second add after every (less than 30 second) level is a big turnoff.",1
Too many ads even for a free game,1
It's ads not game,1
"Constant ads, you have to watch 60 seconds of ads for every 15 seconds of play. App deleted",1
"As a creator on YouTube who runs ads, you put way too many in your game. I understand the need for ads, but you honestly don't need that many. On YouTube for a 20 minute video, you'll see maybe 2 or 3 ads and I make a decent amount. You're just being greedy and the gameplay is subpar only to serve ads every few seconds. Shame mate.",1
This game is absolute trash there's so many ads and the game is super laggy if you want to get any skins that you've earned you have to watch an ad sometimes I get an ad in the middle of the game overall I would a hundred percent not recommend this game!!!,1
This game is absolute trash! 15 seconds of game play followed by 30 seconds of ads. Every single time. Delete!!,1
"Boring and repetitive. You lose people through no fault of your own. If you make a bad choice and lose a level then when you ""replay"" it you find it is completely different so no chance to ""do it right"" the next time.",1
"Its the bare minimum effort of a game made around ad revenue, I don't know how else to describe it, no progression, if you want things you have to watch an ad to get it, I understand and revenue helps people that create free games but this is just a joke",1
So... many... ads...,1
It's so lagy do not download 😒🥶😩,1
Annoying,1
Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads Ads,1
Trash game ads all the time they don't even give you a option to buy ad blocker. Game is rigged once to make it to the 3rd level there are some pallets that you can stand on because they won't let you buy It. Says if you watch ads you'll get a free upgrade which is literally half the game watching ads to get upgraded but instead of letting you upgrade it just sends you into a constant loop of ads some might think oh because it's the last level you have to watch a few more ads than normal. NO!,1
"Yeah, 5 seconds of gameplay for 60 seconds of ads. Pass.",1
So many ads,1
Loj vrk,1
"Another greedy developer, another game ruined by ads. Dusgusting",1
"Too much ads. Like, seriously, it's 70 ads : 30 games.",1
Very bad. So many ads,1
Way way way way way to many ads. I guarantee 98% of people who uninstall this app is because of the ads!,1
If you like ads then this is the game for you. The ads between each level are longer than the level. Not fun enough for the amount you have to see. Uninstalled.,1
Watch 2 ads every time you win a ridiculously easy level,1
"Plenty of amazing ads, but from time to time disturbed by a game...",1
"played two levels, uninstalled it right away. not worth it. if the ads is would just every after 5 levels at least.",1
I genuinely enjoy this game when I'm not watching ads. I would pay 2 or 3 bucks for a pro ad free version but will be uninstalling for now,1
There's no gameplay.,1
why i cant download it,1
This app has way to many ads and on top of that the game is rigged you can never get more than 200+ in people with all the obstacles your always stuck on x5.2 or the most x6.0 thats it waste of time,1
Way too many ads. An ad after each level plus it's the same as over and over. And the crypto ad hasva deceptive X button that doesn't work on one screen and sends you to the play store on the second screen. Very frustrating. I'll be uninstalling this ap immediately.,1
Way too many adverts,1
Way too many ads!,1
Way too many ads to play. No reward just forced watching... skip,1
"An ad after every single level, that you can't skip at all? C'mon...",1
"This game is promising but the devs have some work to do, as of now it would be a fun game, but it's a lagging mess it's impossible to control the game when it lags,but I'll come back to this game if anything changes.",1
هقتزص,1
AD literally every 4 second ROUND!! Waste of space! Uninstalling!!!,1
"Worst ad generator to date. Or I should say the best. Cool game, pleasing to the eye but u will get an ad after every level. Idk how this was allowed on Google play. Game title should read ads up your ace masters",1
"Simply an ad delivery program. You will spend more time waiting for ads to finish than playing. Some games have short ads and can be tolerated. Not this one. Tiny Bubbles is good. The Catapult is also good, as is Archery Elite. These have good playability with tolerable ads. Uninstalled this one.",1
Too many ads. Uninstalling.,1
Too easy so boring.,1
Faking ads,1
Too many adds,1
You end up watching more ads than actually playing the game.,1
Bakvas,1
"Ads, ads, and guess what???? More ads!",1
Too many ads,1
Addddds,1
Too many ads it's annoying,1
Waste of time riddles with ads,1
Over advertising,1
The amount of ads made me uninstall.,1
Very nice to meet you at the end,1
"This game has WAY WAY WAY too many ads, after each level i get an ad, plus the game is really laggy and buggy, i dont recommend playing this game",1
Poor game,1
Advertising- more ads than game... scam x 10,1
Рекламная помойка,1
Disgusting game filled with ads you will vomit ads...,1
I gave it a 1 because it is just to boring 😴 and to easy don't recommend this game so just go hang out with your friends.,1
"Played 2 levels, got an ad after each one, uninstalled",1
Ads,1
Stupid ad app,1
"Too many adds. Play, add, play, add. Half the game is adds.",1
This game is full of advertisements 👎👎👎,1
garbage in every way,1
Nothing but adds,1
Forced commercial for each level played.,1
Do you want me to play the game or watch the ads? Ffs,1
Too many ads!!!,1
"Ads are literally longer than the gameplay time. Couldve been a fun game, but being overly greedy ruined it. I understand ads to support costs but this is next level, after 15 minutes of playing and an untold amount of ads, ill be uninstalling.",1
You play one 15 second round to be hit with 30 second ad.,1
"Constant ad spam and every level is the exact same, it doesn't get any harder or different",1
Too many ads bro slow down jeez,1
Way too many ads. Every play you have there are even more ads!,1
I couldn't get over 4.4x score. No matter how hard I try IM ALLWAYS ON BABY NUMBERS WHERE IS THE FRAMERATE DROPS AND THE DESTROYING OF THE PHONE NUMBERS,1
Top many ads,1
"Too many ads. Level lasts for 4 seconds, ad after every level lasting 10 seconds.",1
It was very bad but no one bot zero stars for you😒😒,1
Just one cuz there a lot of ads and i hate ads 🤢🤢🤢,1
The most rigged phone game I've seen so far. It rigs how many people you get at the end cause the platform isn't big enough to dodge with everyone. It purposely does this to limit how many coins you get at the end,1
Ok,1
would like to play the game but just too many ads,1
"The game is pretty good, but I have uninstalled it because of ads. Ads are on every level(once in 20 seconds)",1
Absolute garbage just like every other game that has ads for it,1
Don.t install,1
Downloaded only to delete... Way too many ads,1
Ads ads ads ads ads. Half your time will be spent on ads.,1
"Way to many ads even when data turned off, don't waste your time.",1
This game sucks to many ads and its way to lagy,1
Tintin,1
Played a few levels before it froze my phone badly after an ad,1
This game glitches and gets very boring. The levels are not hard as well.,1
Bad game lots of ads don't download,1
10 seconds of game 30 seconds of add,1
Too much disturbing adds.,1
Unskippable ads after every round. Can't close the ads when they're finished. Have to close the app and open it just to get rid of the advert. Uninstalled after playing two rounds.,1
Tons of ads,1
Too much adds,1
The ad for this game has the loudest music and I can't mute it. The ad also claims it's playable but redirects you here. That's shady.,1
30 second ad for every level,1
After every game you play you get an advert i wouldn't mind as much if it was after 5 games but it gets to the point when the adds are longer then the gameplay. Very annoying.,1
Rabish review it's so bad I couldn't download it if my friend let me on it as I could see it was all adds and his kid tried to play it but cried because of the adds the game is terrible,1
"This is a bad game,it lagged and glitched my whole tablet pls fix it!",1
Very bad game don't download it😠😡,1
The whole point of the game is to watch ads,1
ADS ADS ADS ADS ADS....................................,1
"Les tableaux sont moins long que les pubs, on a pas le temps d'apprécier le jeu",1
"Adds after every level , not worth it unless you like watching adds !!",1
10 secomd Ads every 10 seconds,1
Good game. 1 star because ads are my pet hate. If you love 50/50 split ads/game this is for you.,1
Way too many ads.,1
Boring,1
only get this if you are happy sitting through ads EVERY 5 SECONDS,1
Good game but as others have said you spend far too long trying to get past adverts. Deleted app after a week. It should be called count adverts.,1
Each level takes 4 to 5 seconds followed by a 30 seconds ad. It's just so painful to play. Uninstalled it after 15 minutes.,1
So much ads...,1
not good,1
It is the stupidest game ever,1
Too many ads. Loosing the tempo.,1
"Too many ads, the game lags whenever something happens and its really annoying",1
To many damn ads. Can't just play the game for a little. Every round has a stupid ad full. Waist of time!,1
Would be a fun game but there's an add after every level and I don't see a place where I could remove adds! See ya!,1
Full of comercials. Plin de reclame!,1
If I could give 0 stars I would because it's SO annoying to have adds after every round or after literally every other interaction,1
خیلی کیریییییییبه,1
"Ads, ads, ads",1
Can't be arsed with the 30 second ads between levels.,1
Stupid,1
Just a bunch of ads. You spend twice the time watching ads than playing. If I could give it no stars I would. This is terrible.,1
lagging and bug...keep it up lol,1
Boring,1
For fun XD,1
Get rid of the ads,1
Laggy,1
"Has a cancerious amount of ads, even with the internet turned off.",1
Way too many ads,1
Terrible Ad service. Play the easiest game ever made for 10 seconds and then enjoy a 15 second ad.,1
It lags and freezes way too much. I've had to restart this app 3 times every time I play and it still doesn't work properly. Over it.,1
Relentless adds. So annoying.,1
Bad,1
"Full of adverts.... could play the game itself for ages but every 45 seconds adverts, what's the point!",1
Hi lm Erin sorry I did not like the game,1
THIS GAME i swear I just started the run and it glitches im giving this dumb app 1 star the ratings from other people looked good so it turns out that the game is TRASH don't download this app I recommend That u download a different app ur welcome.oh and why so much adds like what the.,1
Chirag Urs D. A,1
Good app,1
"to many ads, every god darn time i move or try to double my poeple the lag turns to 1 to 100 real quick this is, even worser when i attack.",1
Too many ads in between every level.,1
Too many ads. Ruins the gaming experience completely.,1
Bad,1
"Do not install , all about ads.",1
Wayyyyyy too mamy ads.,1
longer time for ads than game,1
Absolute garbage; completing one quick level ends in adverts that seem to go on forever.,1
Ads ! Too much ads Like there's ads after every level you finish! That's so annoying.,1
"You end up watching ads more than playing the game. I gave it a chance despite the reviews hoping that the Dev's might have fixed the issue, but it's worse that others described it as.",1
"The ads are terrible. Once you fill the map, it does not advance to another level. You basically just continue going through the gates and accumulating diamonds with nothing to use them for. You repeat the same cycle. The game dead-ends.",1
"So much ads, is impossible to play",1
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,1
To many ad,1
Hang game,1
"Loaded with ads also freezes and glitchy so very dysfunctional, waste of time, not recommended.",1
Dump. Even a stone can make better and funnier games. Why you should pick the lower army multiplier this game is Subway surfers from wish with an unusable extra mechanic,1
Wouldn't bother downloading every level had ads and the levels last about 10 secs,1
way too many ads for levels that short and easy,1
"Yea I tried it, it's cool for the first few rounds. But watching ad after ad after ad, then more ads. Gets old fast. I understand that you have to make money some hoe. Buy after every button you push, an ad pops up. That's just too much",1
SO MANY ADS WHYYYY,1
boring dont install this,1
ADSSSSSSS,1
It sucks if you get 250/300 the game lags you out even with no wifi,1
"Not only is it so glitchy that you lose most of your players, there are ads, then loading, then ads. The levels are designed to make sure you only have a certain amount of players.... It's just a mess. Only worth about 20 min of play (if that)",1
Worst experience its advertisement trap.,1
I understand advertising. But ads after every 10 second long game round? No thank you.,1
More adds than play.,1
Advertisement simulator. You are the product,1
It's literally all ads with every so often a mini game. Oh you want to get more coins? Click this ad. You said no to the ad? Well we're gonna play one anyway so your choice is pointless. It's just another adfarm guys. Download. Downvote it. Move on. Try to avoid the Dev if possible.,1
go hoop HP HP m,1
I wish cancer,1
🤮,1
I did not enjoy playing because of the large number of ads.,1
As stated below 50% of the game is adverts.,1
"First of all, I understand the need for ads, but you need to be more selective in who you allow to put ads on your game. These ads are total trash. I'm uninstalling it primarily for that reason. Beyond that, this game crashes more than a drunk driver.",1
Way to many ads,1
"Gonna keep it short, for the most (90%) will hate this game very short levels you basically spend more time watching adds then playing the game",1
"this game only exists to force people to watch ads. played 5 minutes and was forced, not given the option, to see an ad after every level finished. Each level took about 20 seconds to finish.",1
"If U have many problems just hack it find infty army,inlimited money's",1
way too many ads.,1
"Way too many adds, after every turn like 2 or 3 adds. Ridiculous. Plus it's not at all challenging",1
Do you love ads? Well you wont be disappointed because this game takes the fun out of the game and gives you an ad after every run! Dont slave away! Watch your ads today!,1
Too many ads to be fun,1
Too many ads,1
If you like watching more ads than getting to play a game then this is the perfect app for you!,1
Haven't been playing it,1
So many ads boring game,1
"Ads, ads, more ads. Almost no game to be played.",1
Ads in-between every level. You get 15 seconds of game time for every 40 seconds of ads....,1
Very slowly this is not good,1
Agressive privacy policy,1
It lags to much.,1
Bad,1
Are you kidding with the frequency of ads? I have no idea if this game is any fun. I couldn't stand the 45 seconds of trying to battle myself out of the forced ads just to play for 15 seconds. Quickest Uninstaller if any app yet. How in the world did they get 3.8? The must have had a lot of family and friends give them a 5.,1
10 sec level followed by 30 sec ad . . .,1
भोसड़ी के माधरचोद साला इक दम बेकार खेल है। तेरी माँ का 300 दौड़ने वाला हो जाने पर खेल धीमे चलने लगता है।,1
It's just ads,1
Banks are crops it was not the See you in Seeds,1
Vvv,1
This sucks.. i understand free app have to have adds. But this this is 2 much. After ewry run of 10sec u get add.,1
Too many adds. Can't play. Every level ends with an ad wit no option to skip,1
I am do not like this game,1
Too many ads and it heats up your phone plus you're very limited on how many troops you can get because the obstacles just kill your troops regardless i don't recommend this game,1
This is an ads watching game,1
Cancer of a game made ti waste your time watching ads.,1
Tf was the point of making them stack in a tower,1
Way way way too many adds.,1
Too many ads. Had to close out the game each time an ad played to return to game play.,1
This game is glitchy and it suck,1
Wayy too many ads. I'm literally spending less than 10secs on the actual game just because of these ads,1
Continuous ads,1
10 seconds of gameplay followed by a 30 seconds app. Pretty stupid,1
No gameplay,1
It is a receptacle of advertisement. Stay away,1
Same generic trash game. After every level there is a 30 second ad. AVPOD THIS FAME AT ALL COSTS,1
यह गेम अच्छा है मगर इसमें विज्ञापन इतने आते हैं कि खेलने का मन नहीं करता इसीलिए मैंने इसे हटा दिया,1
Shocking amount of ads,1
"Uninstalled after 3 levels due to being forced to watch 2 ads within the first 2 minutes of playing the game. Not interested, even though the game concept would be addictive.",1
Ads keep coming . Don't download the game .,1
Kak,1
to many ads.. always disturbing me when i want to play.. please fix it..thank you...,1
Nothing but ads. You will spend more time on ads then the game.,1
"This is way to laggy,I literally just got the game and it already stopped that's why I'm giving one star",1
Stupid ads bomb dont install,1
Agahsgs,1
"It has more ads then gameplay, it's basically just an ad farm. Obviously their intention was a money grab rather than making a fun app.",1
Good,1
An ad every 3 second.,1
"The game is what you would expect from watching the videos. Except after every action you do is a 30 second ad. Do a level that takes 10 seconds, 30 second ad. Way way way to many ads.",1
Too many ads,1
"Uninstalled after 10 minutes, the ads are crazy, literally after every 5 seconds...",1
"Press any button in the game to watch an add, far too excessive.",1
To many ads for what it is.,1
You beat a level you watch two ads. Don't waste your time,1
DO NOT GET THIS GAME,1
I liked this game at the beginning but when i reached level 14 it suddenly stopped working. I thought it was a network issue but it wasn't. It spoiled the whole experience. 😕😠😤,1
Way too many ads.,1
Mucha publicidad,1
Well to lagy,1
"Ads after every round, and no real choices. Boring cash grab. Skip.",1
Booooring!!!,1
"It's a simple game. Could have been some mindless fun, but the number of ads quickly make this tedious. You'd have more fun learning how to program and make it yourself.",1
I hate the amount of ads and it makes the game so annoying. How can you have an ad after every level?! Its just so unreasonable which is why I give it this rating. If you can reduce the number of ads I will change my rating and also other people will increase their ratings and more people will download it.,1
"BOMBARDED with ads, mediocre idea at best.",1
"WAY, WAY...too many ads, not worth playing when all you do is watch ads",1
TOO MANY ADS! IT TAKES LONGER THAN THE GAMES ITSELF,1
Bad and i hate it,1
"What a garbage game. The gameplay is short, involves little skill, and is redundant. Then, the game funnels you every 20 second level to a 30 second unskippable ad. You end up spending more time watching ads then playing. At least watching ads means less boring, repetitive game play.",1
You spend over twice as long watching ads (and the entire ad as there is no skip option) than you do playing the mediocre game.,1
Too many ads,1
Awful,1
lots and lots of ads.,1
"During more than half of the play time, is you watching an ad.",1
Too much space 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🤬🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 I am a stupid,1
It's infuriating that you watch more adds then you get to play the god damn game. But gets me even more upset the fact that it's so poorly put together. There isn't a lot to begin with and you'll loose interest within a minute because you're stuck for half the time watching a 30 second add after the 15 second gameplay. These type of games can be so fun and then are ruined by the horrible ratio of adds and gameplay.,1
That's an awful game.... Full of ads that you can't play.. every level have ads.... And speed of control is really slow,1
Absolutely brain dead game,1
This game is horrible. Way too many ads.,1
Way too many ads to play more than a few rounds,1
Too much ads. Very ugly,1
I was forced to watch more ads than I was able to play the actual game.,1
To much ads.,1
Adds! Adds! Adds! I know it's a free game and you need the money but come on?! The level is like 10 seconds and then you need to watch a 20seconds add after every level.. that's why I uninstalled it,1
"The amount of ads in this game gave me cancer. Unfortunately I had just invested all of my money in crypto, as the ads told me to do 500x a day. The crypto market crashed and I didn't have the funds to pay for cancer treatment. I died. I am writing this from heaven. Let me tell you this: it's not worth it.",1
Too many adds,1
Krazy games,1
"There are multiple really long ads after every game, it's crazy.",1
This game steals the Ads rewards that is given to you at end of each round.. Also Also doesn’t allow you make certain in game upgrades with your coins earned. 100% horrible,1
"Way too many ads, 5 star reviews are bots. Plus the levels are too short to actually enjoy them, terrible game all around.",1
Too many ads. Every 30 seconds.,1
Op,1
I just installed got to level 6 AND GOT 11 ADS!! DON'T INSTALL EVER!!!,1
"Too many ads, the game also doesn't give you your rewards after you watch the videos. It's fun but you spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game.",1
Don't download it,1
The ads make this game unplayable,1
"A fun app at the beginning, but there are ads for every level you finish. Say you finish the level in 15 seconds, you now have to watch a 30 second video.",1
😀6⃣2⃣5⃣4⃣6⃣2⃣5⃣4⃣5⃣2⃣2,1
Awful game...it's created just to drive you mad,1
More ad time than gameplay time. Uninstalled.,1
Bakwas,1
"This game prompts an ad after every move you make or run you do. The ads use a method where it tries to detect if you went and did something with the app that they are promoting and you can trick it after clicking around until it goes through. Regardless it's to annoying to install. Pass these greedy idiots up. Note that this game was developed in Minsk, Belarus. 😀",1
"Terrible, way too many ads",1
"Terrible, game kept on freezing and just didn't want to work",1
"ADVERT AFTER ADVERT. EACH AD IS THS SAME LENGTH AS EACH LEVEL OF GAMEPLAY ALMOST, SO YOU SPEND NEARLY AS MUCH TIME PLAYING AS YOU DO WATCHING ADS. SHOCKING",1
Ads ever few second makes the games play tiersome,1
"Ads. So many ads. Also the game is just bad and clearly not a game, just an ad interlude",1
It the best game ever,1
Way TOO many ads!!!!,1
Too many ads,1
"Runs awful. Extreme slow down, and ads constantly",1
I can't watch my ads properly cause of all the gameplay,1
Doesn't reach 6.8. Gets to be slow everything it reaches a high number,1
Play stop the ads there's a 30 second ad after every level:(,1
Too many ads !!!!!!!,1
Waaaay too many ads! Other reviews are not exaggerating. You spend the vast majority of the game waiting for ads to finish. Uninstalled after only a few levels.,1
So much unnecessary ads i had to delete u can't play with out ads popping up all the time bye,1
"10x more ads than gameplay, total bs",1
"Sick of downloading a game, enjoy the silliness of but adverts!! ADVERTS!!! DELETED",1
Finish 1st level straight onto an ad. Not worth it.,1
"Proper for one time try, annoying ads, bad control, bugs",1
You know a developer is only in it for the money when the game has forced you to watch too many ads after every single level!,1
"Quite fun, simple concept but significantly more time spent watching adverts than playing the game.",1
WORST GAME EVER,1
"Every level you go through, you get a commercial. Each level takes about 20-30 secunds. Now you do the math. Look i dont mind watching commercial every once in awhile. But this is too much. The developers are way to gridy. This is a new standard. You cant enjoy what could have been great time killer",1
It OK but son I got it I got bored 😴,1
To much ads,1
"Far, far, far, far far too many ads. Uninstalled",1
Ads ads,1
I love it,1
"DO NOT INSTALL. Initially the game looked interesting, but in reality; it just may be the worst game I've ever installed. Free games use add based income, I get it, I really do. However a 30+ second add for each 5 or 10 seconds of play?",1
"Prepare for more ads than game play. You will see an ad after each level, not worth it..",1
The utter lack of control and calibration on this game is APPALLING!!!!!!! ITS GOING SO FAST YOU JUST GLITCH OFF THE SIDES!!!!!,1
"I want to give even (-) rating as it contains lots of advertisements, don't install you'll get bored",1
It is bad,1
"Too many ads, ruined the gameplay",1
"Add every level, far to much, greed won't get you far",1
ads,1
"Ads last longer than the levels, uninstalled",1
More ads than a game that claims itll pay you for playing,1
Trash,1
Bad!!,1
Ad overload,1
Good game but way too many ads,1
To much adds i will uninstall this game,1
To many adds so annoying,1
To many adds,1
Too many ads,1
Would have been a great little game if greed didn't render it totally unplayable. So many ads one spends more time watching them than playing. User experience is poor,1
"Fun game, but too many ads which ruins the game.",1
would not recamed this game sucks donot let the add get you its only ablout 2 minutes of games and 5 minutes of adds do not click on this game to get uninstall you will be every dispointed,1
This game is good for play timepass but have so much problems no1 problem blank screen no2 problem so much lag no3 problem fix bugs pls update the game ok that it i give 1 stare,1
Um I guess no cuz same as everyone else,1
"Way too many ads, feels like I'm watching ads with a little bit of a game in between them",1
This game is very bad,1
Shittty app,1
Lots of ads,1
Trash add spam game for the developer to just make money. Zero intention to really create a fun game. Same as all the other app store garbage. Just your usual money grab junk,1
really bad controls,1
Ad soaked piece of garbage. Google should ban this developer from the Play Store. You suck donkey taint Freeplay.,1
Bf,1
"I'm a children.There is too many ads, if me ,i will give you zero stars!",1
Ads after ever game (about 10 seconds a game!) Crazy. Cash cow,1
If you like watching ads more than playing a game this is for you. I honestly think you spend more time watching ads than you do playing games,1
Ads after EVERY turn? Ads that open a webpage despite pressing the X? Nah. Thats trash. Seems like a fun game but that was ridiculous.,1
Auto launches on startup.tracks everything you do,1
Adds after each level....,1
Never ever saw so many adverts it's a joke . Would be an OK game otherwise. If you want to spend more time watching ads than actually playing download this,1
This game is one of the game that keeps having ads. Ads keep coming up after done with 1 game. The idea for the overall game is nice but can't enjoy it since ads keep disturbing.,1
One word ADS,1
"Kind of fun, but you will spend as much time watching ads as you do playing",1
Really frustrating obstacles,1
Meh,1
Janky Controlls laggy and far too many ads,1
After everyting there is a ad really bad sucks,1
Shaneni,1
60 sec ad after every level,1
Forced ads.,1
Add after every level not worth the time,1
Ridiculous amount of ads. Literally an ad after every 10 second level.,1
More adds then game,1
To much ad,1
"Unbearable Adverts every single level, even if you turn off WiFi and data (yeah tell me how that works) . Complete sham",1
"Instant uninstall. I don't know which is worse, the horrible ads for this game or the amount of ads in it",1
Very too much ads not interested to play,1
I love the game but the ads are just too much it makes it boring. If it was not for the ads wud have giving 5 🌟,1
"This game is terrible, you sometimes lose even when you get as many men as possible, and its low effort overall",1
boring,1
Boring,1
I didn't even play it. Just wanna add 1 star because of your Stpid shtty Ads. Thank you.,1
"So many ads, not worth playing 🙄",1
Everyone else has to be sure you will,1
"I don't know what I was expecting. This is literally a mini-game, a pretext to shove as many ads as possible in-between the games, which to be clear, are boring and get repetitive in about 5 minutes. The game itself is a lazy, uninteresting, unoriginal money grab. Not to mention the ""graphics"" are ugly and lazy, as the animations, plus, in the first 10 minutes I was asked to unock (with ads) two skins that are blatant rip-offs of designs from other games, namely Among Us and Fall Guys.",1
"Could be addictive, if it got there before ad irritation took over. It is RIDICULOUSLY ad-y. Every. Single. Level. Ad appears. Click to fast forward. Click to close. Wait. Click to close again. Then you have an option to get more get more gems. Via another ad. Developer greedy. Uninstalled.",1
Sujal,1
"ads after each level, you spend more time watching ads than playing the game",1
"Don't bother downloading.. The ads are too frequent and ridiculously long, you also can't skip most ads. Don't waste your time and data.",1
Another game created for ads only.,1
In 15 seconds of gameplay I had to watch three adds. Get in the bin.,1

shovelware at its finest,1
"I have a new idea for the app name. Count Masters: How many ads can you count? Other than there being way too many ads, the gameplay is very boring.",1
Waste Game I Never Seen A Game Like This There Is No Game Only Adds Is There Don't Download Friends 😤😠😡🤬🤬😡😠😤,1
I do not recomend this game it is fun but all the ads just take away youre time and just make it boring and not worth it,1
Too many commercials.,1
"Looks fun in the ads, picking up more and more guys but you don't really. What they don't show in the ads is the obstacles that control how many guys you take over the line. When you get more guys they make a bigger circle, perfect for trimming the edges and making it look like you only lost a few. You'll only ever finish with less than 250 guys. Also don't tap on the bonus round. You will always miss. Hold, then release on the 80.",1
"Too many ads. Spend more time watching than waiting. Disappointing as fun otherwise. There's a balance, this isn't it.",1
"Game so laggy, and too many ads.",1
"Injouable, pub toutes les 15 secondes",1
Ads ads ads and more ads.,1

I am board,1
HOW COME I HAVE TO GET LESS PEOPLE FOR THE STAIRS AND IF I GET A LOT I BEAT THE BOSS CMON JUST LET ME WIN I HATE THIS!! U ALSO DELETED MY COMMENT KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE ADS TO🤬🤬🤬💢💢💢👎,1
Way too many ads!!! You spend more time with ads than playing the actual game!,1
So many ads 🙄,1
Kebanyakan iklan,1
So many ads,1
"Constant ads, boring game",1
Too many add damn,1
"I need more ads, there isn't enough of them. Seriously, one star because there is the lack of ads",1
"Horrible. Laggy, one advert after another. This is literally just advertisements. Stay away from this developer",1
Ad cash cow.,1
BS with the amount of ads,1
"I know tat ads are good for earning passive ince , but please think carefully , how much ads u wan user to watch ?",1
Too much ads not fun at all,1
Too many ads. I would have put 0/5 if I could.,1
Adverts after every level. So annoying!!!! Deleted!!,1
"Just another super simplistic game with more ads than gameplay. Every round lasts around 20-30 seconds and after every round you get a 30 second unskippable ad, choices to pay for something (which is unskippable for a other 5 seconds) and then animations to show some meaningles progression towards a goal that when you reach, you can pay to receive. It could be a fun game, but is cluttered with ads....",1
The advertisements are so intrusive. It takes longer watching the ads that it does playing a level. Spam and trash.,1
Crashed my S9. And had an ad after every level,1
To much ad,1
"This game is simple and could be nice, oweaver there is too much adds. One level takes maybe 30 or 45 seconds to finish, then you have a 30 seconds add. Too much for me even for a free to play game.",1
Very bad mood offed,1
"Yet another good game ruined by the fact you spend more time watching ads. than actually playing? Garbage, uninstalled.",1
Bad,1
Worst game so many adds,1
Way too many ads,1
"Game okay, but the ads run longer than it takes to complete a level.",1
Adds all the time glitching often too. I get it Adds are what sensor your game but thr more Adds you allow the less people downloading it you will get. Sorry uninstalling,1
It's not game it's an app to see ad,1
"Pathetic gameplay to advert ratio, don't bother installing",1
To many adds and the game sucks anyways don't get it its a waste of time,1
Gando bar bar add q data ho,1
F##king Adds,1
if i could give it zero stars i wouldh,1
The ads make it unplayable.,1
"Nothing but adverts, deleted",1
I thought I installed a game and not an advertisement viewing sh*£y application. 😖,1
Disturbing ads making angry 😡 i hate this game never dwld this kind of ad promoting games it would waste our time .This game is completely using for ads otherwise no problem with this game ..I can't recommend this game to anyone.,1
Too much adds,1
Freezes up everytime you get over 150 men,1
Ads after every level horrible dont waste your time,1
Dumb and violent,1
30 sec ads 20 secs into the game. Delete,1
The ads are ridiculous.,1
This is one of the worst ad machines I've ever played. Play a short level and watch a 30 second ad after each one. I bet you spend 75% of your time on this game watching ads. Horrible. Just awful,1
One word: Ads.,1
Ads every 20 secs. Completely ruins this game. Don't even bother with it,1
"I've never experienced so many ads for such low game time. Can't comment on the game itself, couldn't sit through enough ads to play enough to have an opinion.",1
I don't usually mind ads but in this game they are terrible. You spend more time on required ads then the actual game. The game is only so so itself.,1
"Completed one level, got a series of three notification sounds bypassing silent mode that this game was installing three other apps.",1
Toooooo much ads.,1
Boring after 30 seconds of playing,1
Too many annoying ads,1
Too much ads ruins the fun,1
"Horrible forced ads ,",1
"Games good, but the adds everytime the screen changes is ridiculous 🙄",1
There is an ad every two seconds and the game lags a lot,1
"Garbage! Stupid ads before you even get to play the first-time of opening the game. Every level there is a 2 minute ad, obnoxious, trash... Couldnt enjoy game because its littered with ads!",1
Excellent,1
"Terrible, ads ads ads. 20 second level, watch minute worth of ads. Repeat.",1
another 0 effort game,1
I like the game. What I don't like is the reprepresentation of police in the game. Therefore I am uninstalling the game.,1
"Way too many ads, an ad after each round is extremely excessive. Avoid",1
Toooo much ads,1
Donot install this app. Lot of ads and the duration of ads is very long.,1
Horrible! Game is fun but the ads after EVERY LEVEL are very annoying. At least ad an option to remove adds via in app purchase.,1
Stupid game,1
There's just no reason to have an ad that's longer than the level you just played for every single level. I understand ads in free apps but this is too much.,1
"So much irrelevant apps,i hate it cause it shows many advertising",1
More ads than games,1
Has a 10 second advertisement after every single 20 second round...,1
"The ads are unbearable, everytime you finish a level you have to see a very intrusive add, just offer ad free option and charge for it, seriously!",1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Ads !!! ADS !!!,1
This is a normal game,1
Too many ads.,1
What a complete and total waste of time. Ads kill this game and make it damn near unplayable... Uninstalling and making a note to not download any of the other games they advertised.,1
Good game ruined by constant adverts which run longer than the game levels. 10 seconds to complete a level then having to endure a 30 second advert...big thumbs down from me. Installed and deleted.,1
Game is fun but paralyzed by ads. Deleted in 5 mins,1
F@£¥£% ad ! Deleted after 5 min!,1
"Terrible experience with the ads, I tried two level and while the game itself seemed decent in those 30 seconds of gameplay I had a minute of ads",1
An ad every level,1
Same as the rest too many ads and boring game,1
Too many ads.,1
Too much adds.,1
To much advertising!!!,1
Way too many ads and very short levels!,1
Bad game,1
😆,1
"It's really laggy and my phone froze multiple times. It also took up a lot of space. It was a pretty fun game, except for the lag.",1
This game is trash. Non-stop ads make the already bad game unplayable. Dont waste your time.,1
I would rather only poop out pinecones for the rest of my life than play 5 minutes of this horrid garbage. Shame on the company that created this game.,1
"You d .,.7.rr",1
"Ads, so much ads.",1
10%game play 90%ads. Terrible,1
It's a very waste games I don't like this,1
An ad every 10 seconds what a trash experience ad count masters is,1
i tried to install this game but it was useless...it was only pending×3 and pending and it was already 4 days!!! but it was still pending i don't know if its my phone or something else try it out for yourself!!!....,1
Actually this is nice game,1
"Little more than an ad delivery system. The levels themselves are not challenging (e.g., most of the time your choices are obvious: +20 or +5, without having to make quick decisions or do mental estimation to figure out which choice is better). I don't think I failed once. Going to delete.",1
After every lvl completed you get ads,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
The game is just to make you watch ads. Plus if you get enough of the little guys you always finish with around 100 at the end because of unavoidable obstacles. Makes the game rather pointless.,1
"Fixed as hell, you get above 230 and it cancels the rest out, absolutely stupid",1
Advert after every level!!,1
Muito ruim super bugado e o comercial enganoso,1
"Yuckssss this game is so ewwww its so lag and so boring game. So pls dont install this bc when i first tried this game its so boring and lag and so pls dont waste ur time for this game, just install others that worth it😖😑😒",1
Every button you press has a chance of loading an ad.,1
One of the laggiest add-players on Google Play.,1
"the game itself is not bad, but the number of ads is excessive and gets in the way of any enjoyment it has to offer. every so often youre prompted to watch an ad for a prize. if you choose not to... you usually still get an ad anyway, you just dont get the prize. heavily anti-player game",1
This game has so much potential but I deleted it after 2 minutes of playing because of how many ads there were.,1
You spend more time watching adds than actually playing. Dont waste your time.,1
Too many ads,1
Ads up the arse! Game is too easy.,1
Too much ads,1
Terible game,1
Not a game just a bunch od ads stitched together disguised as one.,1
Too many adds,1
"This game is really boring and repetitive, but the worst is the ads frequency.",1
Infested with ads.,1
Good concept ruined by the fact that 90% of your time will be watching adverts.,1
Meh,1
It is very stressful game because in this game always coming adds so I didn't like this game very.........bad game,1
After every level are ads. Enough said,1
Gay,1
Disgusting!!!😠😠😠,1
"the ads are so annoying, can't even enjoy the game because of the amount of ads",1
"It's just impossible to get the max bonus for the number of people that you have at the end, the way they designed the obstacles just makes it impossible to have enough people. Apart from that you get an ad every 20 seconds which is one of the most annoying thing at this type of games.",1
"Ridiculous ad after each level, which is really short and make you feel that the Game was solely built for ads. Uninstalled!",1
Big Chungus fortnite funny wholesome reddit moment Keanu Reeves 100,1
Your ad is so irritating,1
after playing the first level which is less than 30 seconds you get an ad and one after every level which are longer than the levels itself,1
It alright,1
واقعا متاسفم یعنی چی تا آخر دانلودش میکنی دوباره میاد از اول نتمو ب گا داد . تخمی,1
Too many ads,1
"Time waste more ads Kindly don't download ,😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
Great ad viewer 10/10 would recommend Just dont download it to play a game.,1
Glitchy,1
So many ads it's painful,1
To many ads,1
Ad after every level is a bit much.,1
Every two there is a add,1
Fully worst stupid game It's only hang your system It's place is in dustbin not in phone,1
Constantly force closes.,1
Ads upon ads upon ads. Youre watching more ads then youre playing based on time,1
Lag lag i mean so lag and my wifi bar are still full,1
Stressful game,1
Adds after every level make this unplayable,1
Stupid game I try to download it keeps going back to beginning loading again,1
"really sad, laggy",1
Another fake multiplayer game,1
It was very laggy and it always kept going into the lower number section I don't like saying bad thing but it was bad good try work on the ads too many 😐 sorry,1
It don't damlod,1
Levels are short which is fine if there wasn't an ad after every single one.,1
Fun enough but an add is longer than a level and there is an add after every level... don't waste your time.,1
Ad scam nothing more,1
"Most long lasting ads i ever see, awful!!",1
Ads are longer then the game play,1
Ads just ruin the game,1
Ads after every round.,1
"Could have been fun if it wasn't a shameless way to pump ads, it's not even challenging",1
So many ads!!!!!!!!!,1
Ads exceed the limit dude,1
So many ads. After every level an ad,1
Ad farm,1
Another game with ads after every round 😡,1
There is a little bit of game in your ads,1
Tracks everything you do. EEVERYTHING. Invasion of privacy.,1
Good potential but the adverts are overwhelming. More time watching ads than playing this game. Uninstalled.,1
Horrible game... Not actually a game it's an adware. Probably paid someone to fake increase the rating to get to a 3.5 to trap people to download it.,1
Ads are out of control,1
The ads make the game unplayable.,1
Sooo many adds,1
1 billion adds,1
Full of adverts and it is glitchy. My map is currently just stuck. Useless and pointless.,1
"ad after every level, no thank you uninstalled faster than installed",1
AHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAH,1
"The game has a lot of potential, but way too many ads. Un installed after being forced to watch 3 ads in a 1 min time period.",1
Unoriginal game that pushes more ads than game time. Time for this bottom tier companies to get pushed out of the store. Quit rewarding their laziness.,1
"Way too many ads, almost one at the end of every level, and sometimes 2. Plus some of the ads you can't clear easily, even if you do you still get stuck with a 5 second timer. Game itself has its fun merits, but the ads take all of that away.",1
Wish I could rate it 0 stars. Amount of ads ruins gameplay.,1
Played until I got the Amogus skin and stopped there. It was a pretty good place to stop.,1
"Way too many adds,so annoying",1
So. Many. Ads.,1
Far too many ads,1
"Too many ads, deleted",1
I like the game but the rounds are really a short amount of time. The ads are even longer than the round! It would be do good if the up-dated the game.e.g ad every 10 rounds. I wouldn't recommend this game unless your a ad lover!😓😓,1
"The ads are every lvl, play for 10 sec then you have an ad that lasts between 15 to 30 sec after each lvl, so you pretty much end up watching more ads then you get to play the game",1
So slow,1
Best,1
Hang problem in game enternet on hang phone,1
Ads,1
I hate this game you only run wtp,1
"Too much ads, game not playable",1
"Way too easy gameplay and 75% of the time you spend watching ads. If your iq is below 60, this is the game for you.",1
Just ads,1
Sory for tgat but is Very bad game It's just full of ads 💔 You have to watch many ads videos,1
Ads are coming every after game,1
30 second ad for every 30 seconds of gameplay.,1
terrible game,1
a program that freezes the phone and consists only of ads,1
Amazingly annoying ads app. Uninstalled after 3 plays. Wasted good idea bad implementation,1
Ad oriented.👊💦,1
"Played two levels and seen 3 ads, ok, thanks, uninstalled, bye.",1
"Too many advertisements that rob me of my time, patience and internet data.",1
Oh my god how many ads do you need game is sort of ok but never going to be good enough to put up with the ADS!!!!!!!!,1
Far to many ads not worth your time do not download.,1
"Each level you have to watch plenty of ads, exhausting",1
There are more ads than actual Gameplay.,1
Los kharab ghatiya,1
Rubbish continually crashing...,1
Is game ko khalo to hang karta hai,1
This game is waste of time Dhi chod game,1
"on the ad: X3,X4,X.. in real game: +10,+25,+... I hate this game",1
🤭,1
Ads ads ads. Terrible.,1
Way too many ads to enjoy and they cant be disabled,1
Aweful,1
"Full commercial for single level, either succeed or lost. With that extra time of commercial you can literally learn programming, build yourself that exact game and build it without the required frequently commercials videos. Same yourself some time and dont even consider installing it.",1
to many advertisements... sucks,1
There is an ad after every single level whether you choose to watch an ad or not for bonus items. Colors are random and eventually require an ad to select a new one. Instantly a one star due to the oversaturation of ads that interrupt gameplay.,1
"Every action triggers an ad, meh",1
Repetitive and pointless. As soon as you conquer the United States there's nothing else to do and I don't understand the point of the gems? There's nothing to buy so I've amassed hundreds of thousands of gems and have nowhere to spend them. It makes no sense.,1
Get a life,1
Ridiculous amount of time watching adverts. What a waste of time.,1
Although it might look fun which it is don't download it. Way too many ads which makes the game unplayable. This game is a total money grab don't even bother downloading it.,1
Too much add,1
Too much ads!,1
"ADS NEED TO BE MINIMAL Yall are basically downloading this to watch ads 95% of the time with 5min playtime in a span of 35 mins (8 second games,30second ads) uninstalled..not forcing me into giving yall money for no ads when the game is buggy to the MAX",1
Adfest,1
"best wishes to you, I have to be able to make it easier to get the other one message in error, 6, I have been trying, I am a little",1
Ad after ad after ad dont bother,1
Ads aver every round. Annoying,1
Way to many adds unplayable,1
"Terrible. Used app for 4 minutes. 15 seconds actual game play, 3.5 mins watching ads. I played TWO levels and was forced to watch FIVE ads. I hope devs get terrible illness",1
"This is one of the best game I have played on android but then why 1 star! Because of the no of ads in this game, its just too much to handle. I just Uninstaller this game after playing for just only 10 min cause I don't wanna play game who just focus on money making instead of providing better gaming experience to their audience. Shame on you developers. You just made a very good game a cheap ads pop up machine.",1
Ads every 30 seconds,1
Really bad always the same,1
Too many ads..,1
So! Many! Ads!,1
This game is pointless and lame. The currency of crystals accumulate but they have no obvious purpose. Swerve this.,1
Game is good yerr butt after each level there is a add of 30 sec that irritate us,1
To many ads i can't play like that download anf see for ur self,1
Everything is an ad. Finish a level... ad. Build something... ad. Blink.... ad. Heaven forbid you miss pressing the X or >>... sends you to game store.,1
To many ads. Not worth a one stat,1
It's just all ads. Don't install,1
Ads...everywhere...,1
Do irritating game always hanging,1
Way too many adverts. You have ruined the whole thing,1
"Got all the skins in an hour. Too easy. Only has 2 mechanics and one of them is having to watch an ad after every round. I watched a total of 53 ads, and yes, I counted each one. Bad game.",1
"Ads galore, and glitches suck.",1
"Even tho it's fun to play, there is a 29 second add after Every level. I played 10 levels in the hopes the adds would maybe stop being after ever level but nope. And even tho it's fun, it's not something I would pay money for.",1
Absolutely flooded with advertisements. They throw one in your face after ever single stage and it's a coin flip on how long and whether or not you can skip it.,1
"Advertising, More Advertising, More Advertising, Add More Advertising, see if you can just Do Advertising, As if there isn't Enough Advertising on this Game already, I HAVE AN GREAT IDEA, ADD MORE ADVERTISEMENT ON TOP OF ALL ADVERTISEMENTS, THEN ADD MORE,, ADVERTISEMENTS ON TOP OF THOSE ADVERTISEMENTS,, AND THEN ADD MORE ADVERTISEMENTS!!!! WHO EVER THOUGHT OF ADDING ADVERTISEMENTS TO VIDEO GAMES IS AN UTTER FOOL!!! RELAXING,, DONT MEAN I WANNA WATCH 100'S OF ADVERTISEMENTS!!!!",1
Game is good but ads after each level.,1
Its has no graphics,1
"I'm on level 72 and I'm already bored! When you complete the entire USA map, that's all you can do! You can't dominate anywhere else!",1
Add pusher with no endgame. An hour of play and you've experienced the whole game....,1
I get annoying advertisements in games but after every round? No thank you,1
An add after every turn makes this game not worth my time. Its a ludicrous amount of adds to have to sit through,1
This so called game (actually a playable ad) was created to get money from Raid Shadow legends. What gay concept. I uninstalled after round 3. I think I need to get paid for playing this.,1
👎👎👎👎,1
Horrible game let's be honest just a quick money grab with all them ads,1
So. Many. Ads.,1
Only ads ads ads,1
Too many ads!!!!😠,1
"This is an ad exercise. Worthless to the player, bonus csh for the devs.",1
Game's flow sucks + Advertisement sucks.,1
Terrible game to many ads,1
"Constant adverts, literally more time watching adverts than playing the game",1
"The level of commercial is equivalent to the stupidity of the creators.I prefer to to crow a mile on a brocken grass rather watch another commercial,which are 400 on every move...If you think to click on button install, save your self and don't",1
This game sucks. The choices you make do not affect whether you win or lose. You can choose the smallest tile every time but you still win. Terrible game.,1
تذدتفتف,1
Waaaaay too many ads.,1
No download,1
Terrible app ad every level this is garage.,1
So nice game,1
TOO MANY ADS This game is not good enough to have that many ads. Literally ads every level. NOT RECOMMENDED,1
"Sick of all the adverts, too much propaganda and profiteering, don't bother with it no joke theres an add after every game, not worth it",1
"Literally an ad every single level, an ad right after the first level. Not preposterous however it prevents the game from being enjoyable",1
"Easy game, played for 20 mins or so and have had enough of the adverts, out of 20 mins play about 12 mins of ads. Time to uninstall if I want to watch that many ads I will play an ads game.",1
Adfest,1
"It may have been a good game. I was having some fun but EVERYTHING you winds up in Ad'S sometimes 2 or 3 ad""s in a row 30 seconds each. I hit the build and it is 1 click for maybe a second but you have 30 second ad's I hit the build button again and another friggin ad over and over again. Definitely absolutely not worth my time to play a game and I only get 10 percent game and 90 precent ad'a. This game that could not only teach but could be a game just for fun 😱 What the hell. Uninstalled !",1
Ads ads ads ads ads ads,1
"Way too many ads. Ok, I understand advertising is needed for profit.. you guys need money BUT this isn't a fair way to gain revenue, this game is very good although I don't even think I can consider it a game. It's just one big ad INSTALLING IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T WANNA WATCH ADS FOR PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE TIME.",1
Ad player masqueraded as a game,1
"Download this game thought it looks quite cool. the very first level only lasted a few seconds and then I had to watch a 30-second ad with no skip button. tried the second level which only lasted a few seconds and again another 30-second ad, uninstalled",1
Clearly an ad pusher. Simple game play to quickly throw ads at you at every turn. Put a little challenge into it and let up on the ads a little. I get having ads but that's just way too much.,1
Too many adds in every level,1
Can't skip ads and they force ads down your throat every level and upgrade..,1
way too many ads. spend more time watching ads then playing the game. complete waste of time,1
"Yet another ad-to-play game. Ads between levels. Ads to advance. Ads to get into the game. Offers to bypass ads, by having to watch an ad. Deleted...",1
Had this game for 5 min and I am so sick of all the adds already!!! More adds than game.,1
Too much ads that one can not close. DO NOT INSTALL IT!!!!!,1
Ads ads ads very disappointing,1
So stupid and have a lot of ads,1
It dont wanna download :c,1
Stupid game,1
Boring,1
The levels are extremely easy and ridiculously quick. There's an ad after every click. The concept could be fun but it's trash. There's no challenge and it's basically an app of watching ads constantly.,1
Too much advertising... Impossible to play,1
"Too many ads, no option to turn off the volume on ads.",1
Great game if you like adds,1
I like the game but way too many ads. Deleted after 5 minutes.,1
90% of gameplay is ads... Not recommended.,1
"The game is very simple and it has short levels. With this many ads, i deleted it within 3 hours.",1
10 seconds game 30 seconds adds. Uninstalled 10 minutes later.,1
"Ads every 5 to 15 seconds , game is alright but so cluttered with ads it is not worth the download",1
Tooòoo much ads...can't explain,1
More adds then game.,1
Fun game but watching an ad after every level gets old fast.,1
Every break in the action has a long ad break. Not interested in a basic game that is essentially just ad revenue for the developer.,1
Too many ads,1
"Utterly sheit due to the fact that their ""trick"" to get you to pay is to make it close to 50/50 AD time and game time on your screen when you play. Will be uninstalling this ASAP.",1
"If I could rate this less than one star, I would. It's a decent enough game. However, there are way too many ads. A minimum of one per level.",1
Third Class bulky advertisement,1
THIS GAME IS OKAY AND IT HAS A LOT OF ADS AND IM OKAY WITH ADS BUT THIS IS ridiculous,1
"Absolute trash, nothing but adds and advertisement traps. Stay away.",1
Ads after every level means an uninstall for me.,1
To many adds.. Too many... This is awful u come to play a game n u only see adds,1

2 ads per level not worth playing,1
Ads are longer than a round . It's round then Ad round Ad round Ad,1
There are many ads and ads. plz who had made this game requested to remove the ads,1
"It won't let me load to the game even though I redownload it like 3 time, so bad:)",1
There is a game in you ad display app. Maybe get rid of that so its all ads,1
Bleehh hate this game,1
Too many ads,1
"Buggy, when I get to bonus the game freezes and I have to exit out and go back in. Not fun when that happens",1
Too much ads,1
"Mindlessly easy, and packed to the ceiling with ads. Don't waste your time.",1
Let's be honest ... the dumbest game! Maybe the creators of this game are just as stupid.,1
Worst,1
"Too easy, no depth. Seems like it's just a cheap way to make you watch ads",1
Way too many ads.,1
Not good,1
Bad ഗെയിം,1
pure ads,1
"This game doesn't have ads, it's more like the ads has a game. It's impossible to play.",1
Totaly useless game dont wast your time and internet,1
Over 50% of time spent was looking at adds,1
Shame on you people,1
This is poop,1
Wayyy too many ads. It's unplayable.,1
Stupid,1
Game was better but some time when no. Is more like 567 the are not working,1
There is an AD after each level. Ridiculously annoying.,1
"Typical ad grab. Don't waste your time. No real gameplay here, just a few seconds of distraction to get you to the next ad.",1
Tati sali madhar chod game,1
everyone is saying that there are so many ads so I will stand up for them . It is not fair that we have to watch ads . I think I will give this a one or two star rating because of this rude game.,1
Ads galore and so easy... Zzzzz....,1

Garbage game that has way too many ads even with wifi off,1
Game is buffering,1

Loads of ads occasionally interrupted by a worthless game. Don't bother.,1
"Ad trash, 1 stage = 1 non skippeable ad",1
Can't play even the tutorial because of all the ads.,1
Spent more time looking at ads then playing,1
I better keep playing Minecraft because this app stink s,1
I was warned about the ads. So disruptive to the game which is unfortunate because I enjoyed the concept,1

This is the most worst game I have ever seen because - 1 Lots of ads in between the game . 2 It hangs a lot in game . 3 If I not want to go to left or right side it goes there. So sorry I can give only one start to this game and I have uninstale this game very very sorry 🙏🙏,1
"Can you add more ads , i think you should add more of them 🤣",1
Ad ever 15 Seconds,1
I love this game.it glitched alot at first. not so much since it updated.i love the sandcastle cannor shoots.i hate it now they went back 2 stairs it slow back.plus this stupid attack village 🤬😡😤🤬🤬🤬🤬 why change it!!!!!,1
Too many ads.,1
Glitchy! The game also froze on me twice at the boss fight.,1
What a horrible game! If you wanna play you have to watch adds! Are you kidding? Who wants play this game?!,1
🙂🙂🙂,1
Really just a bad game runs slowly and just like any poorly made mobile ad game. Don't recommend.,1
Horrible it laged so bad the grafics are tarible,1
"Hi, I have some criticisms of the game. First, the game is designed so that fewer people intentionally reach their destination. Second, enemy arrows follow the opener like missiles. The third game is completely buggy",1
Far too many adverts,1
Laggy and filled with endless ads,1
Too many ads. Ads after every level. Level takes 10 seconds ad is longer. Played 2 levels. Uninstalling.,1
This is Trash 🤣🤣🗑️ Like how can you download this lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂So bad,1
Ads as soon as I finished the intro level.,1
Rediculous amount of ads that ruin the game overall!! Supposed to be freeware which of course explains an ad or two but not after every single freaking level! It's rediculous!!,1
Very laggy (im using a phone that has 12 ram with a very good cpu and its laggy) lots of ads,1
Chitiya,1
Way too many ads and the game is too easy,1
"Ads in every single games , plus some case when you want to click .",1
This is poor,1
"Every single time you pass a level, there's an unskippable ad.",1
Waaaaay too many adds!,1
Way way way too many ads. There's an add after every level. Deleting.,1
this game is sooo laggy it instantly crashed. not recomend getting it,1
Nothng but ADS SUCKS! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,1
Stupid game,1
Advertisement. There are 30 seconds advertising videos every 12 seconds of gaming.,1
Ads every step of the way and they take longer to get through then the levels. What a waste of time. Disgusted with every one raping me with advertisments.,1
Ads between each step you do and it breaks the flow making it unenjoyable.,1
There are so many ads that you can't enjoy the game. 🤬,1
Terrible,1
The absolute worst game for ads. There's literally an ad between EVERY level that lasts 1 minute. What a joke!,1
A pretty decent game ruined by an overwhelming amount of video ads. Levels take about 15 seconds then you're forced to watch an ad. Absolute joke.,1
"Literally an ad after every single level. Some of them are the ones where you can't skip and have to watch the 30 second clips. However, there is an ad after every single level and some levels last less time than the ads themselves. You will spend more time watching ads on this game than you will actually playing it.",1
Dt,1
The app crashes all the time...even when im about to win then it just freezes then crash,1
Rather give 0 for adverts every 1 minute,1
To many ads,1
Er,1
"You can't change the outcome of this game, you lose too many stickmen. Waste of time",1
Try,1
Too many ads,1
"The game is buggy because of the Ads. Their is an ad on the game that you literally cannot bypass, even after the ad plays. You have to literally shut the game down and come back in.",1
Adfest,1
This game sucks,1
Played the pornhub music on the ad in public,1
the game doesn't really progress its super easy and boring after some time. and the most annoying thing after each lever there is an ad.,1
Don't download this it's boring really really boring,1
Pagal game,1
"Raw ad cancer. Complete a level get an ad. Get some 'currency' have an ad. Watch an ad, watch another ad... terrible",1
Ads after every 5 sec level,1
hehehehehehe,1
Laymwerstg ame,1
Too many ads,1
"Way too many ads and hardly any content. Gems are so easy to get you can max out the island within 30 minutes of playing and the levels are almost mindless... that is when you can play them between the ads. I'd get more excitement watching paint dry, because at least something is happening. Maybe the ads are a good thing to try and pull me away from this game.",1
Adds every level. Adds so often the game isn't worth playing.,1
boring,1
It's fun for 1 minute. The levels is super short like 1 second followed by 60 second commercial... No thank you.,1
Basically an ad app with a minigame in between. Such a cash grab,1
I dont like stupid ads ads and ads,1
"Too many ads the levels are short but the ads can't be skipped and are longer than the level itself, would be more enjoyable with out them after every level",1
To many ads,1
Too many ads. Ain't worth my time.,1
Too many ads,1
Not nice and very boring,1
Add pollution,1
"Has potential, advert time exceeds game play time. Thank you very much for making it then undeserving my attention with intrusive adverts.... Just uninstalled...",1
Bad,1
More ads than gameplay.,1
Uhjt,1
This game is boring,1
Boring. Too easy and way too many ads.,1
these douchebags put unclosable ads on other games. highly frustrating.,1
Nice game,1
You play 10sec to watch 30sec of ads. Uninstalled after 5 min,1
Every time a ad pops up it freezes and makes me start the game all over I just got the game and having problems with it already 🙄,1
Reeks with ads. Pure cancer.,1
"This game is laggy and boring. There's ads after every level and it makes me not want to play it. It's basically the same thing over and over. It's fun at first but then it gets boring and I can't even get past 100 people, it starts to lag as soon as I make it to 200 or above. It would be a nice game if the quality wasn't so horrid. Don't play this game unless you like laggy and bad games. Lol",1
Too many ads,1
Ads,1
"Jogabilidade ruim, fecha do nada, trava mto HORROROSO na propaganda parecia melhor",1
Idont like this game,1
"3/4 of the time is ads. Great game, totally spoiled by ads.",1
Long commercials after every level. Totally destroys the value of this game. Don't download unless you enjoy being constantly annoyed by banal advertisements.,1
Adverts.... adverts... oh and more adverts.... I mean come on!!!!.... this takes the P***,1
So so many ads! Between every level...I can't stand it. At least let me do a few levels or purchase a no ad version. Uninstalling it!,1
Too much ads,1
I don't think I'm going to enjoy this game,1
Trash game full of ads and every reward u want to get is required to see an ad this is the worst game i've ever played,1
"So many adverts, long and unskippable after each small gameplay",1
Non-stop ads,1
Way too many ads,1
The levels are too short and too many ads!,1
The worst is that huge amount of advertisement.,1
Ads very bad 30 seconds ads,1
Pathetic. Don't waste your time. This game is nothing but ADS for other games and bullcrap ...... You spend more time watching ads than playing the actual game!!,1
Too many adds. Makes it a nuisance to play,1
Bad,1
Very bad game full of ads,1
Yfg Hi,1
Omg best part of game was uninstalling it I'd rather fall on my death then play this poor game or should i say ad show,1
Bodoh,1
so many ad .. disguised,1
good,1
2 seconds of game play 20s of advertisement,1
Levels are super short. Ads between every level are longer than actual levels. By the looks of the reviews I'm not the only one to say this. But Holy... chill on the ads. Uninstalling,1
Too damn many ads!,1
"SO MANY ADS! An ad every minute after finishing each round! Its ridiculous! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! There are other, better, similar games out there.",1
Not very challenging and the ads kill the game,1
Dont play this game too many adds,1
Stupid ad machine,1
It lags so much,1
Nice,1
"The best app for those who love seeing ads. The levels are incredibly small and there are ads before each level, which makes the game unplayable.",1
way too many ads,1
The ad for this game is stupid so I came here just to put a low rating.,1
Too much ads even for a free to play game. Watching ads whole time rather than playing any reasonable amount.,1
"Lags a lot, and really boring... zzzz",1
Ads are annoying. Have to watch an ad after each and every stage,1
If I could give half a heart I would it's like my phone has a virus its is lagging so bad I have to get a new one so thx so fun buying a new phone 😡,1
Gave up after dealing with unskippable ads after each round.,1
"Ads with a Game. I know ads are in most free games, but you get about 15 seconds of play time and then you watch 2 ads that you can't skip through, wasting about 30-60 seconds in between each 15 second level. Then you have to watch adds to unlock items like skins and such. Good game, but terrible amount of ads. They also don't have an option to pay for no ads.",1
Ads are way too frequent and way too long. You are watching ads for more time than you're playing.,1
ugly game 😡😡😡😡,1
"Garbage. Ruined by commercials literally every 4 to 5 seconds of gameplay, you're forced to watch 30 seconds of commercials. As said, garbage.",1
Made for add display,1
"Very very disappointing that one of the club-wielding enemies that you face is dressed as a police officer. The police force deserves our respect and support, not adding to a negative image by glorifying negative stereotypes. It was a good game up until that point. NOT COOL. :(",1
Too many ads,1
Worst game,1
"Immediate unskipable ads, waste of time. I dont usually erite reviews but damn man, you're not even trying",1
Stupid every 5secs there's ads,1
Meh ok game would be a lot more addictive and a lot more entertaining if it wasn't for the ads after every single level... I understand wanting ad money but this is rediculous... Uninstalling after 2 minute of play time and after 5 ads,1
How can you show 15-20s ads after every level? This is awful. Uninstalled it after a few levels.,1
Good game? Idk. It's just broken,1
Too many ads to be enjoyable. Pretty much afraid to click anything because an ad's going to pop up and I usually can't find how to mute it. Uninstalling.,1
Jdnsmaksm Stupid,1
Disruptive ads EVERY step you take. I know it's free but puh-lease :|,1
"Way too many ads. I ended up watching more ads then playing. I understand the ads are a revenue steam, but this is too much.",1
Fool app,1
"They use an Ad every 2 seconds, not a fun game",1
k e e p l a g g I n gl,1
This game has so much potential but the ads are absolutely ridiculous and I have earned so many gems but there is nothing to spend them on? Weird,1
Horrible game and too many ads,1
Good 👍,1
"Seems like a fun game, but it's more ads than playtime. Had to delete it after 10 minutes.",1
VERY BAD GAME IT SUCKS,1
Have a lot of Ad it's soon boring👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,1
Nothing but adds. You spend more time watching adds than playing the game. Don't download unless you love looking at adds.,1
More ad watching than actual game time.,1
Everywhere are ads. Cannot escape this trap. Everything is unlocked with first buy it and then watching a ad to actually get it ads. After Every level there is a ad and each level is 5secs long. So you get the idea,1
"I get that this is a free game and ads are part of it, but some of the ads are very inappropriate in an adult sexual way, as I often play with my young daughter I do not want her seeing them so will need to delete this game.",1
"Lovely little time wasting game. Only problem is that each level only lasts about 10 seconds then you get a 30 second advert, so you spend more time stuck on adverts rather than actually playing the game. Surely the companies that pay developers to advertise on game aren't getting their monies worth as i'm sure most people end up uninstalling after playing game for a few minutes.",1
This game has an ad every action you do. Blatant cashgrab. Don't play.,1
"Very very boring game , nothing new all levels are the same and not even a challenging ,try to add something interesting .",1
More ads than gameplay.,1
Unplayable AD server.,1
More time showing adverts than there is gameplay.,1
"Spams forceful video ads, makes phone heat up",1
Don't install this app very much bad app ever .I hate this app.This app is full of ad. Game is interested but there are many ads in offline also.,1
"too much adds, difficulty increases too slowly. All in all not worth it",1
There are lots of lag and on a phone it just goes everywhere I'm definitely giving it a 1 star,1
Akash Kichha m s,1
💩💩💩,1
Crashed first 5 sec in. Laggy af,1
"2 ads after every round, insane!",1
"Ad,ad,ad,ad uninstall",1
"Ads ads ads bruh I get you need income but jfc CHILL I played for maybe 5 minutes and watch 6 ads, seriously?",1
More time is spent on ads than the game,1
Huge advertising,1
"Ads ads ads, avoid this ad simulator!",1
Ads everytime. Install Uninstaller after. 1 minute!,1
Its good,1
"Too many adverts. Even when I skip the video for bonus points, they still make me watch a video. Deleted the game",1
You do not need internet to play this game. Stop lying.,1
If you want to spend more time watching apps and playing a game this game is for you.,1
Sooooo many ads...argh,1
"Really a nice game but, the most annoying ads after each and every level, I uninstalled after 5 mins of annoying ads, other than that nice game",1
"If i could give it 0 i would. This game has so many ads! I understand that ads give you money but its extremely annoying!! Worst part is, the actual game is like.. 10-20 seconds. You dont really get to play the game. The game is basically an ad. It's so distrasoually annoying! Think about the players who like the game but cant play it🙁. Please get rid of some ads and let the players play. I really like these kinds of game this one is unique but many ads. Please fix this!",1
As much time watching ads as playing. 5 mins trying the game and have uninstalled it!,1
To many ads,1
It's just a rip-off,1
"REALLY RUBBISH AND TOO MUCH ADS IS ALL IM SAYING, I WISH TO GIVE THIS 0 STAR RATING!!!!!",1
Too many ads popping up. I uninstalled the game cause of it,1

Too many ads. I see more ads than gamelan,1
Ads .. so uninstall this app,1

كافي كسعلة مطلعين ألي اعلان وفوك محاطين اعلان طويل منكدر نسوي سكيب ومن يخلص الاعلان ومخلينة ننتضر ٣ ثواني حتى نسوي سكب أبلعوا نزلت لعبة حتى أحط نجمة وحدة وهسة امسحها,1
Too much publicities,1
After every level and a level takes 10 seconds,1
Useless game,1
Under 5game and so many ads how can a child play .,1
The ads take longer than the levels. There are more ads than actual game play on this app. This is not a game this is a billboard you can interact with every once an a while.,1
Pub every 10 sec...,1
the worst game ever that i ever seen in my life,1
You spend more time waiting to close the ads then you do playing the game..,1
What the why did this nvm ima get to the point. Listin the game is fine but there's ads almost every level and the ad for this is just stupid,1
Мало рекламы,1
Its a hard game stupid but just be 1000'00 blue player or 1 player but change color and fight enemies,1
Too much reclame between game.,1
The ads are ridiculous!!! You spend twice as long watching ads as you do playing the game. Worthless app. They should be paying you to play this.,1
I don't want to be that bad but there are WAYYY too many ads bro most of time you just watch ads. Like in every level there's an ad bro that makes the game disgusting i even think that developers don't even care about the experience they just want more money and i disrespect that bro,1
Troppe pubblicità,1
No matter how many units u earn the barrier s wont let you get more than 200 That means no point of playing the game,1
Horrible worked for an award and watched two ads and it gave me nada meaning nothing.,1
"Waste of time. If you want to play a game, I would stay away from this game. You spend more time watching ads rather than play the game. You literally watch a 30 second to full minute ad after each level.",1
Same thing over and over.,1
Far too many ads. You play a level for 10 seconds to then watch an ad for 30 seconds. After every single level is just too much. Greed has spoiled the game,1
Absolute rubbish,1
Its just a game about ads.,1
"Game is ok for killing time, but you'll spend two thirds of your time watching adverts",1
Simplistic game designed to deliver ads,1
Games alright. Adds are to long and after every level,1
Barri bakwas game hai,1
To many ads. Not great game play. It's just a money maker for the devs,1
"Ads, ads, ads and erm... more ads.",1
Annoying ads.,1
More ads,1
Ads,1

Ungodly amount of ads! I've played game with lots of ads before but this is on another level. After every play??!! Come on,1
Forced adds,1
Not really a game unless watching endless ads is a game,1
More ads than gameplay.,1
Agreed. More time in ads than playing. Take note of your reviews and reduce ad time. Uninstalled,1
Bombards you with ads. There's about as much time spent playing as there is watching ads.,1
More ad time then gaming,1
More ads than gameplay,1
Sure I'd like it if it didn't lag every other second so I can't move anything so I just die.,1
Literally more ads than game. I've never seen anything like this. Uninstalling now,1
Everywhere you turn your head someone's advertising this b.s. game. You know you can make it actually good instead of all these ads right? The game itself is just one boring billboard with a bunch of blue dudes running around to make it look like a game.,1
Buggy garbage with too many ads. AVOID.,1
Ban this aap Because so many adds in this aap,1
"Installed it, within 3 play unistalled as well, as after every level theres a foceful ad which you cant skip.",1
😂,1

This game is not worth playing wayy too many ads.,1
Literally more ads than gameplay.,1
Dont like,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
It suc so bad fix it,1
Haha,1
"SO MANY ADS!!!. The replay value of this game sucks so much, solely because of how many ads there are. Let people complete more than one VERY SHORT LEVEL before you start shoving ads down their throats. Jeez!",1
Advertisments every 45 seconds.,1
Why in the holy name of god are all the ads unskipable,1
vedprakas Sao,1

Force you to watch 30sec ads after each stage ....,1
Shittiest game ever with too many ads.,1

"Don't waste your time, none stop adverts.",1
thevdiyapasangala otha game ha da uthu,1
This game has so many ads like play it for 2 rounds there is a 20 second ad,1
Just don't ever make a game again 🤮,1
Trash.,1
"A person spends 90% of the time watching ads and 10% of the time actually playing the game! You get hit with 2 ads in a row that you can't close, and then you play for 15 seconds and then back to ads! It's ridiculous! It's great if you want to be bombarded with ads!",1
"The game is very fun to play, but the ads make it unplayable.",1
LOOK MA A GAME FOR RACISTS!,1
This is to glchie it so garbege so bad,1
"I understand that you make money from ads, but unfortunately for me is too much to watch ads after every level. It's super annoying.",1
very bad,1
"Ads after every round, ads take more time than the round.",1
Busy,1
The game hangs suddenly when my people score is above 200. I need to exit the game and start again. This is not good 😐😐,1
omg! the amount of ads in this game made me crazy!,1
Whoops looks like there was a tiny bit of game in between my ads,1
Games is fun but too many ads!!,1
After every single game add... Rubbish!!,1
I lile the game but the 30-60 seconds of ads after every 15 second level are too much. Unistalled after 10 minutes of play time.,1
Not actually a game. Just an application that forces you to watch ads in order to do anything. Terrible.,1
I was so disappointed this game had the opportunity to be fun but gives you 10 seconds of play time then a 30 second commercial. Uninstalling.,1
Ads are disturbing,1
It has a lot of boring Ads,1
All you do is watch adds. Absolutely do not waste your time on this,1
30 second Ad played after 15 seconds of gameplay. That's a no from me dawg,1
I don't know what's on devs minds for these app games like I understand ads are one of the main ways to make money off the game but an ad everytime you complete a level is just sad plus a banner below simply just trying to squeeze so many in it ruins the experience I enjoyed the game just couldn't keep playing as I got feed up with getting an ad everytime I completed a single level,1
evry one second ads and the game 🥱 ng,1
Garbage optimization with more ads than gameplay. Avoid like the plague!,1
Too many ads!!!!!!!!!!,1
garbage to many ads and laggy,1
Very bad game only ads and ads .very bad 😔 experience .,1
This game is just a waste of time you have to many ads and persinal info i think its stupi,1
Boring game,1
Way too many ads,1
Too many ads,1
This game is full of ads and levels are very short all for all this is a boring game,1
Way to many ads and gets boring quickly.,1
Not a fun game way to many ads if you can't do basic math go back to elementary school dont play this game,1
Its a fun game but SUPER AD HEAVY GAME you do one thing ad pops complete a lvl ad comes up wanna unlock something ad comes up there's even an ad on the bottom of the screen before starting a lvl it's honestly not worth playing cuz the ads ruin the game hard like I don't mind ads here and there but this one takes the freaking cake,1
"Just like the other reviews said. Too many ads, extremely repetitive, was only fun for the first couple of runs or so. After that, it's more like something to do to pass time. I find it extremely annoying that you can't seem to have more than around ~100-130 avatars on the path at once. Whenever I get more than that obstacles deliberately knock off about half of them. From a game designers standpoint, I say this game has potential, but needs to be reworked a bit. Especially level design.",1
This game is the worst!!,1
"Not fun, devoid of anything rewarding. Would never open this app even if it didn't have 8 ads a minute",1
Not good I want to vomit,1
It won't download,1
Too many ads without a way to shut them down Cash grab,1
Boring. Nothing more to build completed the island after that it's a 5 maybe 10 second level then a 30 second add uninstalling 🥱,1
Watch an ad after every 15 seconds of game? No thanks!,1
Es mas publicidad que juego,1
So nice,1
"Far far too many ads (one at the end of every round, rounds lasts like 10 seconds.) Not worth it, installed after two levels.",1
Like the game but the ads are RIDICULOUS! Can anyone tell me what the diamonds are for?,1
Too much ad,1
I would do zero but I can't,1
To many adds,1
Si game is good But lagging is the problem .lagges a lot .,1
Boring.,1

too many ads,1
Too much ads,1
If you love 20% game & 80% ads then this is the game for you! Literally for every 10 seconds of game play there is a minute of ads.,1
2sec game 30sec adds,1
Wayyy to many ads. You spend more time forced to watch ads then you get to play.,1
I'm giving online one star because there are so many ads and is so annoying that I need to uninstall 🙄,1
"too much ads, really bad experience!!!",1
This games only purpose is to make you watch ads 0/10,1
Parth,1
When i have n lot of people it freezes,1
Holy Freakin Ads!,1
15 seconds of play and then a 30 second ad. I gave it a few levels in case it was a mistake but nope. Literally more ads than play time,1
"Disgusting, add filled, bad design, it's the typical game that has an aggressive monetization and it's targeted to last a couple of months.",1
Ads are INSANE!!!! Has the makings of a good game but too many ads make it unbearable. I understand you have to have some ads... but that is just ridiculous!!!,1
Way too many ads. I deleted the app rather quickly.,1
Valo noy,1
It takes too long to load and my son what to play the game 👿,1
Rishtej,1
"It's such an amazing game but after every level you've to watch ads, gets stuck for bonus boxes, can't get new figure and ads ads ads ... No more interested",1
Too many ads,1
"Too many ads, uninstalled..",1
"Too many ads. An ad after every single level, some ads lasting longer than the level themselves.",1
Too much lag 🤬🤬,1
This is very bad because you will collect all the men after that the game will give a stupid obstacle that will kill all my men.very bad,1
boring,1
"This game is super glitchy the touch, cordanation and comand of the little figure is way off on tio of its kicking you out and freezing on boss levels.",1
"Ad, ad, ad and oh wait another Ad! Complete conquering ""America"" and no progression. No possible way of scoring more than 190 blue men across the finishing line...",1
Horrible game just spams ads DO NOT GET THIS,1
5 seconds gameplay and 15-30 seconds advertising. Could have been fun if it at least was the other way around.,1
Too many ads!!! Don't play,1
10second level followed by 30second advert....after every level. Seriously?,1
"Game is OK, but the ads ever 10 seconds are annoying and pause the music I have running in the background. Uninstalling",1
very nice game my name is prachi,1
Commercials appear after every round. Commercials are longer than the rounds!,1
Zone 12*36😘,1

Ads masters,1
This game is unplayable there are so many ads,1
This game is very good but there is a problem when my army is above 200 the game will be hang.,1
Ads its ok but pop up and redirect is too much.. loser dev,1
This game is definitely a time killer. It's fun if you don't mind a ton of ads. There's an ad after every level. If you try to increase your points every so often you have the choice to watch an ad but after watching the ad you don't get the points. The only option after the ad is to watch an ad for the extra points. It isn't fun enough to deal with all the ad traps. Uninstalling.,1
"So many ads, I forget what Im even playing.",1
"To many ads, even for the free version",1
Too many adds. After every level,1
Just downloaded the game to write a review. This game looks like there are adds every 30 seconds.,1
"Game to boring downloaded it played for barely 15min and wanted to uninstall it already.Too many ads,ads are crushing restart the app give me back the same ad and crush again wonder why people like this game🤦‍♀️",1
This game is show in advertise,1
Ad watching simulator and nothing else,1
"Worst game I experienced so far.,",1
Very very bad,1
Any game that forces adds = 1 star and uninstall. Be creative like ads for rewards not for simply playing!,1
Too much ads. Uninstalled it within 5 mins,1
"Too easy, and too many ads to be enjoyable.",1
Adfest deluxe,1
30 second adverts for every 10 seconds of gameplay.,1
This is so repetitive and boring,1
Can you 10,1
"Holy ads, you spend more time watching ads then actually playing",1
كل شوي إعلان,1
Far too many ads. Ads play after every level and take about as long as the levels themselves.,1
15second game 30seconds advertise,1
Wish I listened to the comments about continuous ads because I've played for less than a min and had 2 adz already 🥲😡,1
"The game itself is great fun, but it's hampered by constant advertising - between each short level. It's too much even by mobile gaming standards.",1
"Way to many ads, uninstalled it after the first 15 minutes of playing. Spent more time watching ads than playing the game.",1
Decent little game absolutely destroyed by ads. Played for 10mins then uninstalled. Shame.,1
"Full of ads, unplayable",1
More ads than gameplay.,1
"Please get rid of the adds. It's so irritating, comes up everytime before a new level.",1
Two levels. Two ads. Uninstall.,1
Poor,1
Very bad game cant even move properly,1
"Too many ads, spend more time watching ads then playing which is a shame because its a chill game.",1
Very bad game. Add also comes a lot.,1
Two 10 second rounds then a 30 second ad. One 10 second round then another 30 second ad. That's a 2 to 1 ad to gaming ratio which is not for me so uninstalled.,1
Literally 98% ads,1
nice game,1
There is a monster in the last bonus we have actuall 100 mans,1
There's an ad after every level.,1
Aburrido,1
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😈💩💩💩💩💩,1
Too much ads . ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️,1
Poor experience and just an excuse for advertisements,1
The amount of ads appearing before and after the stage make the game so annoying and unplayable.,1
You people don't let people play the game peacefully.... There are ways to sell ad....Your way is just unprofessional...,1
Too many ads,1
I was so excited to play when I read that I need to agree to give away all my information... I uninstall right the way,1
Waste. Full of ads. That to terrible ad,1
Yarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,1
Si t'as plus que 300 mecs sur le rainté le jeu explose,1
Boring game + ads,1
Slow,1
Too many ads,1
Bad game,1
its besutiful game,1
"Like the game but really, an advert after EVERY level? A new low.",1
To many ads,1
"10% gameplay, 90% ads. you are literally afraid to click anywhere because of random ads.",1
Crip vs blood,1
"While the game is kinda fun and a little addictive, the huge downside is that you get an advert after every level, sometimes me than one! So you'll be spending more time watching than playing. I couldn't even find a setting (or any settings for that matter) that would let me pay a one-off fee to get rid of adverts.",1
"Says a lot when a dev can't even be bothered to put sounds in their game. Also, WAY too many ads.",1
It feels more like its ads with a few games inbetween than the other way around. Would not recommend at all,1
TOO MUCH ADS,1
Ads are really bad...,1
I installed and then uninstalled immediately after reading reviews lol,1
"Ad after every play no matter if you win or lose. To many ads, most games only use ads after you lose. This game is every time, no matter what. Lasted 3 minutes and took it off. Stupid",1
Too much bad app. This app full of ad's and force to watch ads,1
Rubbish.. far too many ads..avoid!,1
Good night,1
Worst app we can't play the game peacefully full of ads PLZZ don't download it🤬🤬,1
"Ad after every level, some unskipable. It occasionally offers an item for an ad, but if you say lose it the ad plays anyway. Levels are short, yet it could be enjoyable - the ads however make this game completely unplayable.",1
So stupide and many ads videos for 1 min u can not exit,1
"didn't really get to play the game, very nice ads tho",1
Very interesting game but adds are just killing it...im deleting it right away,1
"Too easy, ads galore, uninteresting. It's just a money grab from ad revenue.",1
It's horrible,1
Add masters,1
the game is,1
Too many ads,1
Uninstall due to adds.,1
Too many ads,1
"Terrible game, too many ads",1
More ads than game,1
Could've been a great time killer. But too many ads with no option to skip,1
I waited five minutes for it to load and the screen was still blank . Can you make your game a little optimized,1
too many ads,1
"Way, way too many ads. No need for that many ads. This app deserves the low rating it has. Horrible",1
Worst game,1
"Ads, all the ads....",1
If you have time to waste after every 5 seconds of playing the game to watch an advert then this game is for you. Otherwise don't bother waste your time,1
A lot of Ads,1
There are way to many ads I can rarely play there are more ad time then the game time I'm gonna have to Uninstalle I hade like 5 seconds of playing before a ad,1
"Ad after every single turn, save yourself the time",1
"After trying out this game, I was really disappointed with the graphics, the concept, quality, and lack of background music. Every time with try to move my characters from side-to-side, the game would lag almost instantly. Second, when I got to the first boss, my characters went back away from him for some reason and I had to close the application and open it back up again. And the worst part about this game was the ads. Every level would have ads playing after you complete them. I'm okay with having ads instead of paying to play this game, but I don't want to see them in every level and only when you had 4 or 5 retries. As much as I want to keep playing this game, I just can't bring myself to do it. Here are some problems that need fixing: 1: Fix the lag and quality of the game. 2: Don't make the characters walk away from the bosses, but instead have them charge at them. 3: Only show the ads if you respawn from a level 4 or 5 times.",1
Too many ads! There's one after each game you play! Ugg!!,1
Ads loud and annoying I don't care about ads but when they come on where you can't mute them and they interrupt you trying to listen to music it makes the game pretty unplayable considering,1
The adds are anoying at a degree of 100/10,1
This game is crazy. I try to to unlock characters it loads the add.,1
This is a boring game,1
That only ads😠😠😡😡😡,1
Ads after every level don't waste you're time,1
Shyam,1
"Boring, many ads",1
gets boring very fast and is barely even a game,1
Full of ads after Playing one round,1
A game to made to make them cash. By you watching ads for everything you do. No gameplay/skills. Just ads...,1
Good as always,1
Alright game that really needs to ditch the advertisement IV it's using to cling to life.,1
More ads than game.,1
It back on Monday and I Search 10 of time but not open Hi Friends you shome your challenge name and I subscrib you,1
way too many adds,1
Stupid,1
"Ads, ads, ads. 2 ads after every stage and the rewards is useless. Avoid like the plaque.",1
"The game is pretty fun I got to say it's ""addicting"":-) Unfortunately though this APP freezes after you win a couple levels😒 and on top of that there are so many ads 😣😣😣",1
ads ads ads and more ads,1
Too many adds,1
Getting an ad after every minute long level gets old quick,1
Awful game based on you watching ads,1
Onr big INFOMERCIAL.....Sad,1
I thought this game was boring and there were to many ads and basically all i was doing was running iro walls and other crowds,1
Too many ads worst game ever.,1
Very lagging and too many ads,1
Not fun laggy hated ot,1
Too many ads,1
I like the concept of the game. After every turn there is an ad and the ads are longer than your game play.,1
"The gameplay is fine, but there are way to many ads. There are ads after every stage, which becomes tiring FAST. Additionally its required to watch ads to get certain upgrades and skins. All these ads combined make the game unplayable.",1
Worst Game,1
"I have never seen so many ads in such a short space of time. Each level takes about 10 seconds to play, then there's at least 5 seconds of advert. The game isn't good enough to justify it, this is purely the designers getting greedy.",1
It's an AD farming game. This game only exists to farm advertisment money. Shame on the devs for this pile of garbage. 🤙 Best part about it is that it loads so fast (since I'm sure it was made in 5 minutes from a template) you can close out of the game when an ad starts and load in before the ad would have ended. Consider adding tons of gigs of random nonsense to make it harder to load in for more ad revenue.,1
Too much ads,1
Sooo many adds,1
Trashy just straight up trash,1
Far too many ads,1
If you like ads this is the perfect game for you,1
Faltu game,1
"Fun game, but not worth the absurd amount of ads. This game is 100% an ad farm.",1
THE GAME WONT EVEN OPEN LOL,1
"Fun game...but...you have to watch an ad after EVERY LEVEL. The levels only last for about 20 seconds, so it's way too often. Not worth it at all.",1
Ads.,1
Its not a good game,1
This game might be fun but you'll never know because of the amount of adds you have to watch!,1
"Deleted after realizing how many ads there are. Play for 6 seconds, watch a 30 second ad, repeat. Absolutely terrible",1
Fun game but way to many ads,1
Too many ads. Reduce the amount to make this game enjoyable.,1
Simple boring game with ads every 2 seconds.,1
Too many ads,1
Ads ads ads. After every level and for 30 unskipable seconds each time.,1
"Ad after every single level, this game is unplayable, I understand the need for ads but this is excessive!!",1
"Its fun game but the worst thing that its trying hard to make you not even pass the 150 people i hate that thing, saddly im gonna uninstall the game",1
It's extremely irritating to have an ad pop up after every single level. I've played for about 10 minutes and most of it was waiting for ads to finish. No thanks.,1
Don't even bother downloading unless you feel like watching ads every 3 seconds.,1
Ur game is full of ads,1
"Could have been fun. 15 sec gameplay, 3 min ads. Not worth it.",1
"60 second ads, for a 20 second level.",1
"More adverts than gameplay, totally ruined by adverts. The game lasts 10 seconds then you have to watch a 30second advert. I downloaded the game and deleted 10 minutes later",1
So many adds,1
No control when moving.,1
The game could be a lot of fun if there was one change. There are more ads time then play time. Let me pay 1.99 for am ad free version and I'd be happy.,1
The game is actually good but ads are ridiculous! Uninstalled after 5 mins,1
Advert after advert after advert..... I'll never recommend a game with this many ads.,1
Quite a few complaints. 1. Repetitive and gets old quick 2. So many ads.. like more ad than game 3. Super laggy. Get over 200 guys and the group will glitch all over the place and you'll lose them. 4. What are the gems for? Got my island fully built and all the island gives you is gems... What would I use them for if the island is fully built? No point 5. Ads only sometimes work 6. Got all the skins the first day. Do not recommend at all. May have fun for a day,1
dirty,1
Too many ads. Too easy. Too repetitive.,1
All ads,1
I did not like this game all ads,1
Full of ads Would be a cool game if not,1
A game lasts around 30s Then right after a 30s add pops up. I think the game to ads ratio is 50 50,1
To many ads,1
Imagine making the reward for progress: viewing more ads. Get out of here reported application for spam.,1
Imagine watching 10 seconds of youtube videos where every video has commercials at beginning AND end,1
Le doy una estrella por que hay un poco de juego en su publicidad. Idiotas,1
Too many ads,1
Very bad ads,1
Way too many ads. 30 second ads in between 5 second levels.,1
"I thought this was a good game at first, I even paid for no ads! It's getting boring now because the questions are getting extremely repetitive and more for the American audience! One question was name an animal that lays eggs, I put Duckbilledplatypus, they declined it, its the only mammal that lays eggs.... I'm English and have no clue who plays in the NFL etc? IT'S A THUMBS DOWN FROM ME 👎",1
It's not good so so so bad,1
💖💖💖💖💗💗💗💗💗💗,1
Too many ads,1
Nice concept ruined by in essence an advert machine for the developer 25-30 seconds of adds for every 12 seconds of gameplay? don't be greedy!,1
More ads than game. UNINSTALL,1
"Too many ads, finish a level - ads. Get skins - ads. Upgrade anything - ads.",1
There is an ad after every level. Got tired of it after 2. The ads are longer than the levels.,1
Complete rubbish. You could get stabbed with a knife and have a more enjoyable time.,1
A level lasts about 10 seconds and then you get a 30 second ad. Every Single Time! The game may be ok if you actually spent any time playing it. Deleted.,1
"To many ads, it's ridiculous",1
"Ad every 30 seconds, not fun",1
Dumb game too many in app ads,1
Good I i was so good for me is a good time⌚😊😊 for a good😎 day and I was so happy i was so much fun😝 of question of🎒📚 ii bet you have been so long,1
I played this game for 15 minutes and got like 456 adds dont get it too many adds,1
Ads,1
"Fun game simple concept but im so sick of the ads. Everything is just a new ad pop up. Clear a level ad, uograde ad, spin for colors ad this app is just a marketing scheme and it's sad to see this is the only way new app developers are able to thrive is behind bs like this. Smh. Literally had the game for 5 minutes and already about to uninstall. Just pathetic.",1
Bruh ads,1
Could be a great game. But is glitchy and crashes alot,1
Very buggy lots of glitching,1
"There were so many ads and they were all so long and would appear at every single step. For less than 10 seconds of playtime at each level I had to watch like 4 ads. So annoying, I uninstalled it the same day",1
So easy,1
Too many ads,1
Don't love this game,1
"Great app to view the latest ads, mini games interspersed between each ad to keep your mind active. I'd give it a perfect 5 out of 7.",1
So much lags,1
If there were an ad for every level... Oh wait there is and it's annoying,1
Excellent,1
Stupid game,1
I downloaded the game just to write a review. These games are bad and you guys are the problom! Everyone who downloads and opens the app a single time gives them money so why wouldn't they make more games. STOP PLAYING THESE GAMES!,1
Ads ads and more ads,1
"Boring, repetitive and I've never seen as many ads in my life",1
It's does not work when I played the game it does not show,1
Freezes up,1
"10 second play, 60 sec ads. No thanks",1
If I could rate it lower I would. Seems to be just another cash grab in a series of games with just enough content to be considered a game and with rounds lasting no longer than 30 seconds with advertisements after every round. Absolutely disgusting behaviour by the developers. I will never play another game developed by you or anyone associated with you. SCUM.,1
Tons of ads,1
Waaaayyy to many ads. Uninstalled within 5 minutes.,1
"Fun game, to many adds, after every level",1
Game se jada to ads h,1
Too many ads,1
Soooooooo many adds,1
Way to many adds,1
"These gaming developers are just useless. If U got no money or skills to start a game, then don't start it at all. Start another career. Getting ads to pay your way is just annoying. Go get a real job U stupidFks. Way too many ads. Uninstalled it",1
The ads are ridiculous! Unplayable. And the crypto ones... no. Done. Screw this. Don't do it.,1
"Add an option to buy the game or turn the ads off. Seriously, I've played ONE level of this game. 30 seconds. And I'm blocked by an ad I can't close? I've already installed and won't be reinstalling until this is shorted. Absolute joke of a game.",1
Marvin the only thing I can think about the only one of its own experiences as well as well and the right to roblox to roblox and I just wanted you to roblox and I just wanted to roblox and I just wanted to be free to roblox and I just got back to roblox and I just got home,1
It too easy,1
Advert at end of each level. Rubbish game play,1
To many commercials 🤭💖👎🏽,1
Ll,1
"Fun only for a few minutes. There is no real progression, levels never change in difficulty and are just randomly generated, you get bombarded with ads after every round. Classic over-advertised money grab.",1
Adware,1
"The more you play, the more ads you get. Seriously doesn't start out bad, there is enough mix to keep you mildly entertained. Then the ads start over and over. After every level. Battles cannot be beat on first two attempts and you have to watch ads.",1
"Typical adware game. Levels are approximately 10 seconds long, always followed by at least three ads. Uninstall.",1
Too easy and too many ads. Very short levels for very long ads. The creators didn't even try that hard for this game and it clearly just a cash grab,1
It's glitches and it's horrible,1
"Simple game, clearly made just to make money out of excessive ads.",1
"It is just the simple trap to watch ads. Putting ads to the game is normal if your game is playable. But this game has no optimization, ads coming each second and so on.",1
Too much advertising,1
This game is the worst I can't download it,1
"Money hungry, cool idea but 30 seconds ads for every 10 seconds of playtime is obnoxious",1
The amount of ads is insane.,1
So much ADS 🤯,1
Boring. They give you the opportunity to get a lot of men but then immediately kill them off because pile is too wide. No controls. Even if you take your finger away they won't stop. Big yawn festival.,1
You'll get bored in a few minutes. Engagement rate -10%.,1
20 seconds play time 5 min advertisement.,1
Amazing game I just can not canrol,1
For every 20 seconds of play you get 2mins of ads. Have fun.,1
Not worth 1 star. You have ruined what could be a great game with your silly add interruptions. Half way through a battle an add disrupts the game. Spend more time watching adds than playing. Uninstalled due to adds adds adds. Take my advice and search people for better game. Avoid this creators games unless u like adds more than playing games.....,1
Great review😎,1
Ads longer than gameplay,1
The ads For this game are obviously fake and there's so many ads in the game that I spend more time watching ads than I do playing the game,1
Way too many ads,1
"Vaguely fun, but not worth the ads.",1
Ur mom,1
"Ads, ads and more ads. 5 to 10 seconds of play then 3 to 5 mins of ads if you're lucky could be longer",1
"Repetitive, not challenging.",1
"Lowest bm days MA'AM Zumba to the Lord of the client is in my it's not important thing to church with them and good morning also because of respect for women and children in school of medicine and more years to come over night me plaza yrs ago, ok MA'AM the Lord Jesus them to your family and friends with me nag quarantine lang kay mao jud me makita sad among schedule for kids for the night game is at a government employee too your wife is not the type of our daughter she is not to say that there",1
"Way too many ads, 1 before and after each level",1
我下載這個遊戲不是來玩的，是特地來批評你們那噁心的廣告。你們在其他遊戲裡面設下廣告那也算了，廣告結束後直接跳到遊戲的畫面，讓我以為你們是想讓我試玩你們的遊戲，結果一碰直接給我跳去Google Play，讓當時的我氣的轟炸。還有，每一次玩別的遊戲時，每次跳廣告都是跳你們的廣告，而且還很多次，在其他遊戲也是一樣的。我坦白說，你們的團隊不用花那麼多的錢去給廣告費，這樣不僅省下錢，你們的遊戲名聲也可以好一些。總之，你們的廣告是我看過最噁心的一個，沒有之一，謝謝，不必送。🙏,1
Way way way too many ads.,1
"1st experience was an ad that made the game freeze... Was about 10 seconds before it happened, it has the potential to be a fun game now I'm uninstalling.",1
Gaurav. Manoj. Kor Manoj Kor,1
Ads after each round.,1
Ye ad bht gnd marwane aa jaate hai....😑😑😑,1
Bad,1
"If you love ads after completing every single level, this game is for you",1
Way too many stupid ads. Uninstalled after 15 minutes of ads. More like 2 minutes of play and 13 minutes of ads. Very disappointed.,1
This game sucks and you know it when the offline game freezes and Lags. It could be much better if they would fix the lagging problem,1
"It's not fun, there are bunch of ads :@",1
Advert after every level completed uninstalled,1
To many ads. Literally an ad after each round and the ad is longer than the round you just played.,1
it sucks. too many ads,1
Don't waste your time .... Full of ads and glitches on a very simplistic game. It's not worth it.,1
This game is boring,1
Nice game but constant adverts made me uninstall.,1
Seriously too many ads,1
"There is a bug, when you have to play before watching the commercials. That's crazy. When you fix this so I can watch only the commercials, then I will give you 5 stars.",1
Unbearable amount of ads. Was potentially quite a fun game but on average a 30s ad every 45 seconds.,1
bad,1
This is very to much bad game 😠,1
Too many ads,1
It was funny but it takes to long to install,1
it was so bad,1
TOO MANY FORCED ADS! GAME NOT WORTH IT! GREEDY DEVS! DO NOT INSTALL!!!,1
Really nice game but unbeliveable how many ads are there...,1
"More ad avoidance time than game time, uninstalled.",1
Too many ads,1
Ad farming app.,1
So many ads,1
"No difficulty, many ads. Game just to get you to mindlessly play and watch ads for revenue",1
"Good game,lots of ads so deleted",1
"Ridiculous amount of ads, uninstalled.",1
Boring!!!!!!,1
"Don't bother installing, play 10 seconds a round and watch a 30 second ad.",1
Greedy ad cash grab by ripping off older game formats and shoving them together. Can't even disable data to kill the ads cause the game won't run offline.,1
Garbage,1
Ads no matter what you click only enjoyable for 5mins,1
An ad after each game. Let's give any app with such massive ads 1 star,1
"Download this game to watch ads sorry this is a ad app, kill this ad app and build new",1
"Too many ads and no option to buy ad-free. It's fun enough that I'd spend a couple of bucks for ad-free. However, as mentioned before, you'll spend more time watching add than playing the game.",1
Ad after add after add there is to many ads,1
Viewing Ads more than actual gaming time,1
"Advert after every single level. No word of a lie, you spend 50% of your time playing, and 50% watching ads. Pisstake",1
"Just ads, that's all. You win a level, Ad, you loos a level, Ad, you want to upgrade, Ad",1
When it finished loading I tried to play and the screen was black every time i tried. DONT GET THIS GAME!! Its a waist of time.,1
"Dull game, too many ads",1
Games not bad just that it's full of ads,1
Hate adds again and again,1
Ads try to deficult,1
This trash of a game runs ads on other games and there is no X to close it or any other way to dismiss it. Enjoy your review.,1
Literally more ads than game time.,1
Foarte multă reclamă,1
80% of time is forced ad viewing,1
More adds than game,1
Play 30s and 2min of ads,1
"fix the games, too many ad. thts make me feel crazy",1
I dident have no spase to play,1
The worst app it have more adds very bad game don't install it it's too bad game very irritating adds,1
Just an add farm,1
"OK app to pass the time. But damnn the fuxxxxing ads everytime you do someting, naaah.",1
The amount of ads is appalling,1
Too many ads. You spend as much time watching ads as playing the game. A shame.,1
Worst ads ever. There is more ads then the game,1
Ad Bait,1
Ads after every level last longer than the level. Gameplay itself is brain-dead,1
EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. HAS. ADS!!!! GETS BORING REEEAAAALLLLLL QUICK!!!!,1
So Many annoying ads with sound included almost half of play time. Uninstalled the same day,1
The game is good but not worth the time. Too many ads before and after you play a level.😐 Trust me don't waste your time🤨,1
Theres more ads than there is gameplay,1
More ad's than game,1
Bakwas Game kabhi 6.2 ke aage jate he nahi bakwassss . Please do not download this game pls,1
Not a good game,1
Only for ads,1
"Ads, ads, ads, and more ads",1
Long Ads after every run even if you win. Ads even when upgrading using your earned coins. D l S G U S T l N G ... M O N E Y - G R A B B E R,1
"This game is bad. Too many ads. And the game concept sucks. Finish level, ADS! start the game, ADS! oh finally unlock character, ADS! in the middle of the game: oh look a key, ADS!!!",1
Too many ads,1
I hat this game,1
"Of i could give 0 stars i would i only played this for an hour because i was sooo bloody bored, not worth it i hated every second of it",1
too many ads,1
5 seconds to play a level... 30 second ad after each one... What a joke,1
Ads are longer than the levels.,1
Worst ad infestation I've ever seen in an app total joke.,1
So much ads,1
It was impossible to win,1
Don't get this,1
Too much ads and not good looking ads,1
Trash. All of it. Thousands of ads in only 5 mins the review mechanism sucks I typed a whole long paragraph and it bugged and deleted it all. The game sucks and broke within the first 6 minutes of playing. Would give zero stars.,1
"No challenge and constant ads. The ""battle"" tells you how to win every time. Kinda seems like this game is only made to get money for ads.",1
Enforced uneccessary ads,1
Worst game I ever played. ADS AREKILLING!!!!,1
Horrible. It's just watching ads with little bits of gameplay in between.,1
Just a cash grab. The game is okay but the ads are too much.,1
ENDLESS ADS,1
Ad simulator,1
If I could I'd give this 0 stars. You spend more time looking at ads than playing.,1
This game is noob,1
So bad 0 stars. But we have to give 1 star because we can not post this message,1
Too many adds,1
After every play you mast watch an advertisement for 30 seconds or at best 10 seconds. It is frustrating and lost interest very very fast.,1
"This is an ad farm and nothing else. Within 5 minutes of starting the app I was shown at least 6 or 7 unskippable adds. The skins require ads, the upgrades require ads, everything is built around making you watch as many ads as possible. Play literally anything else.",1
Game is good but there are so many Ads. I uninstalled it.,1
Not NEARLY enough LGBTQIAIIP+ representation in this game. Do NOT install EVER.,1
Way too many ads. Uninstalled after 10 minutes. I would have paid for a version with no ads. Goodbye,1
"This game lags too much, even with a gaming phone. Please fix it, if you get over 100 people the game just lags tons and if the ""boss"" comes it will bug out and you just gave to restart the game.",1
Littered littered littered with ads just like making the app understand no no no,1
5-10 seconds game play followed by 30 second ads.... completely ruins the experience.,1
Waste of time...Unlimited ads and the same thing repeats.,1
I go up 100 lvl and still maximum crowd was 150-180. All the levels are same.,1
10 seconds playing first level then 60 second advertisement? Really? What a waste of time.,1
Too many ads,1
Great you complete a level here is an ad. Oh no you died here an ad. you want upgrade to your character here's an ad. Now I've know why I don't games on phone too many pointless ad,1
Hate this game bcoz of many adds,1
Kpo,1
Very bad game.,1
noob,1
Game is more ad than game,1
Intrusive ads. Poor gameplay.,1
This isn't a game...this is an ad. With a little gaming sprinkled in. 20 seconds after install... guaranteed forced ad.,1
"I think its worlds worst aap , , lot of ads",1
The game is fun but too much ads. I reclmmend you to play without network connection,1
More time watching ads than playing. Uninstalled.,1
Too many adverts. Keeps freezing on black screen.,1
You want a game that all you do is watch ads after every level well then this is the perfect game!! You will never stop watching ads and will have more minutes watching ads then minutes playing the game.,1
Ad after every single level,1
"Terlalu banyak iklan, main 1 level,iklan,1 level iklan lagi",1
Too many ads ruin the game experience,1
"MANY ADS, THAT'S IT.",1
Too many ads,1
"10 second playing than 30 second ads. So if you play this game for 1 hour thats mean you only play for 15 minutes, the other 45 minutes u just watching the ads. WASTING TIME !!",1
This game is complete garbabge 20 seconds of game 2 minutes of ads what hot garbage.,1
"Would & might be fun, etc if the controls actually worked to manuver thru the course.",1

So many ads,1
This game is really bad.add every minitue.,1
"Jesus the ads, tone it down a little",1
Fun game but too many ads.,1
If the apps name is changed into advertisement counter. I might have counted more. Such is the intrusive ads and few don't have an option to skip also. Game is simple and fun to the level of killing some time or let kids enjoy for few rounds.,1
Way too many adds,1
Way too many ads,1
"It was kinda fun at first, but once you build all you can build & conquer America, there's really nothing else to do except watch ads for fun, if you call that fun. Yes, tons of ads as basically every review has mentioned.",1
Comercial.......,1
So many ads!!!,1
Garbage game full of ads and its rigged is legit impossible to get more than 150 dude's cuz when you get more the game instantly kills off half of your power,1
That way to many ads I think I spent more time watching ads then playing. It will be the last time I play. I'm not inpressed😡,1
Very porr game,1
To many ads,1
Very bad game,1
Garbage! TONS of ads and they FORCE you in to the Play Store to download when you try to close them. DO NOT DOWNLOAD this App!!!,1
"Ads ads and ads, unplayable",1
this game should rename to Ads masters,1
Have no idea if this is a good game or not because every 5 seconds there's an ad that runs for 30 seconds at full volume.,1
Too easy and and too many ads,1
Too many adds.worthless,1
"Too much ads, wait time",1
So many ads,1
Its disgusting how after every stage there's an app,1
"Very witty, bad in a funny way.",1
"Decent gameplay, except for the fact you're hit with ads between every level, and they take longer to go through than any level does, so no, I do not recommend this game",1
Gra nawet spoko ale co poziom to reklama 30 sekund z których nawet nic się nie dostaje przez co więcej się ogląda reklam niż się gra...,1
Dumb,1
Bad UX. So many Ads.,1
Firstly I cannot play this game without putting my wifi or mobile data off... It's highly annoying. Secondly how do you expect to build a larger crowd when the game makes it impossible. Thirdly I've noticed that when going up the stairs the game doesn't score you accordingly especially when you have a high number... Some of us like playing a good game when we done with work and household chores even if it's a simple game at least sort out the scoring of the game. Thank you,1
Too many ads. Don't waste your time installing it.,1
It's not a good game. It is very very bad game.,1
"Games don't increase in difficulty, math is wrong no increase in points with the more little dudes you get passed the finish line and adds are extremely excessive",1
"Fun simple game. However, the in game forced video ads are out of control. Literally at the end of each match a 1min+ ad will play. If they could limit this to once every 10 minutes I would continue to play. I do not recommend, just because of the ads",1
To many ads,1
Unplayable bcs of ads,1
I don't get why it is the best game on here it is dump and I hate it,1
Not worth it waaaay too many ads,1
Fun games but you click on more ads then playing the game 🤬🤬🤬,1
"Unplayable. Ads after EVERY. SINGLE. ROUND. I get it the app is free and they have to make the money somehow, but you see more ads than the game itself. 1/10 would not recommend.",1
"Literally an add every 6 seconds. Plus the push notifications 10 seconds into playing the game, while the game was open. Uninstaller minutes after downloading. Too bad, could been fun...",1
Truly epic amount of ads.,1
Let's put an ad in every single spot we can put it in and between every scene. Uninstalled.,1
Way too many adds. No way of getting rid of the ads.,1
Ads between every level. Spend more time watching adds the playing game,1

"Uh, nope. There's more ad time than actual game play.",1
Time scam game advertising every min,1
Another shovelware mobile game where the gameplay is bare minimum and unoriginal. the gameplay is but a spoon to make choking down the advertisements less unbearable,1
"Abplsute garbge, terrible game, filled with ads. It's a scam",1
Horrible! Got stuck in the third game.,1
"Way too many ADs! This game was okay except the ""cop"" bad guy at the end portrayed beating the small characters... Deleted now that's pretty uncalled for... There were plenty of other figures to use in that spot it's very unnecessary.",1
The adverts are ridiculous. Never play again,1
Boring,1
Ads,1
It's not perfect it has very small area to play with. can't get more then 120 mini men just waste of time too many trapes which are very near to each other. Not giving any stars 👎👎,1

Faltu game,1
I enjoyed it until they portrayed a police officer being the enemy. Uninstalled,1
"This is a really good idea for a game but soooooo badly executed; way too many ads which make it super laggy, and it's just far too easy. The game is packed full of extra details like the gems which is totally unnecessary. I'd rather pay 99p for this game and have it paired down without ads and just a challenging game.",1
Horrible game full of Advertising and lags so hard it makes the game hard don't get this Sh#@ game,1
Extremely short game play and ads every level,1
Supper game,1
Full of Ad..,1
Nice advertising skills,1
Ad spam,1
Unplayable due to too many ads.,1
A slightly amusing game completely ruined by the constant adverts for other stupid games. I don't do adverts.,1
Worst app. Too many adds.,1
I can't go back to the game after an ad.,1
Too many ads,1
The fact that every review complains about constant ads kind of explains it all.,1
More ads then gameplay. 10 seks level. 30 seconds ads. Not worth it,1
IT WOULDN'T LET ME DOWNLOAD IT ON MY OTHER PHONE I WAS JUST WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING AND WOULDN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD I WAITED FIVE OR FOUR TIMES,1
"Too many ads. Ads too long. Got to a reward, had to watch the ad, but the game didn't give the reward. Watched the ad 3 times, still no reward. Scam game. Don't download.",1
Too many ads,1
"Way to many flipping ads,great god",1
Why so many adverts???? It spoils the game. You literally play for 10 seconds then have 20 seconds of adverts....it drives you mad...so mad I've uninstalled it straight away....I fully appreciate that the company needs to make money but there are just too many adverts for me ....sorry. I love the game idea though,1
"Gameplay is okay. Adverts are atrocious, one 30 second add every level.",1
To many adds,1
Adds,1
Way to much adds. Even when upgrading units.,1
To many add and the game crashes or lags really bad.,1
Not very good having to watch a 30 second advert after every level. Uninstalled.,1
Worst game. Lots of ads.. I spent more time on watching ads only instead of playing... It don't deserve single star.,1
Medgvj Ugvu,1
Ads are shown for each breath you make while this app is running. Unbelievable!,1
Soooooooo many advertisements,1
worst game ever so much ad in this game,1
Devolep advertising apps,1
The Ads are ridiculously long and can't be skipped. Sometimes an ad gets over but before you can click the X another ad pops up. Fun game but I'm uninstalling it because it's almost unplayable.,1
It's not a game. It's app of ads !,1
Game is rigged to drop your guys down with unavoidable obstacles. Had over 200 on the screen and one stupid wall cut it to half.,1
It sucks,1
Too much adds,1
Ad overload. There is an ad after just about every action.,1
Too many ads,1
It's boring,1
"Too many ads , irritating",1
"Hey, I'm here to review the games you see in ads, so you don't have to play them! To say the least, this game sucks, probably made in a few hours, with literally zero challenge, zero effort, and zero fun, that plus the annoying attempts at getting you to watch ads after every level, I'm just going to paste this review to every one of these ""math battle"" games",1
"The game is an ad infested cash grab, and the gameplay is repetitive as hell. Don't download",1
Too many ads. After every round.,1
Put more ads,1
😫,1
Very bad👎,1
30 second gameplay - 2 minute ads after every game.,1
"Bruh, It's Just A Ripoff Of Crowd Fight 3D With WAY Too Many Ads.",1
"This game is fine but what really gets to me is how often there are ads. Every time you want to change your appearance you have to watch an ad. Finish a 10 second level, ad. If you switch to the side game, you get rewarded with more diamonds and to get them you have to watch ads. There is no way to purchase them away either. Even if there was it would probably only apply to certain ads... Honestly this game got boring after a few days.",1
This is just an advert machine hideen behind a very boring game,1
Level 1? ads. Level 2? ads. Upgrade income? ads. Ads? Ads.,1
Wrost game ever in my life,1
Very very bad 😂,1
"Watching Ads NON STOP. If you click literally any button you're getting an Ad. It's insane. Ruins this game. I understand, ya it's a free game. Literally every button click is an Ad. Don't waste your time. It's not THAT fun.",1

"I thought the ads wouldn't be that bad, but damn I was wrong, they put me off immediately, games also really repetitive, too easy and hella boring........don't waste ur time",1
It's ok... if you like stopping to watch a 3 minute ad after every 30 seconds worth of gameplay. How do people get away with pumping out these garbage games that are clearly a blatant and not even subtle cash grab? Complete waste of time.,1
Too much ads,1
Wah,1
Heavy ads long ones to after each game,1
Far too many advertisements for it to be enjoyable. One 30second advert every 20seconds not worth the time it took to download let alone to play,1
Weird,1
"10 second play, 30 seconds of advertising.",1

would be cool if 1 the game wouldent proform like hot trash 2 stop giving forced ads after ever level complete 3 give the game more spice. more upgrades. its very boring after 5 minutes at this state of the game i do not recommend it. with alot less ads ir play it offline (witch is a pain always to change) i would give the game 4 stars.,1
Worst game ever repeat do NOT play its too many adds and just boring,1
Not sure,1
Unplayable. Too many ads.,1
Too many adds,1
full with ads,1
"It's embarrassing for me to say this but I played 40 rounds. Everytime you want to do anything you get an ad. Most of the ads are highly sexualized. I wanted to get the humon gus skin and all ""random"" prizes were all rigged. For example, you are given 3 crates and told you that you could get a minecraft skin. You could only open 2 with an ad and I did this several times and never got a skin. There are only 9 skins and after getting them there is no point to continue playing. I would recommend.",1
this game is not fun,1
Its been pending for 2 hours,1
Ads,1
100% 1%game play don't waste your time.,1
This game is bad,1

Game is alright but you have a commercial after every level that gets old quick.,1

Too many adverts!! It's that simple. Not worth your time downloading.,1
Good game,1
Ads only,1
Fk ads. Wasting my time.,1
ABSOLUTELY TOO MANY ADS!!!!! RE DAMN DICULOUS,1
"Bored after 5 levels, spend more time watching ads than playing the game, unistalled.",1
Too many ads takes the fun out of it every time you complete a level there's an ad right in your face,1
Ads ads more ads then more ads again then ads,1
Too much ads,1
"Muito anuncio, trava muito, nao consegui jogar",1
Why can't I open it 😠,1
Ad,1
"If you enjoy 15 seconds of gameplay followed by 60 second ads, then this game is for you!",1
"Way too many ads for this to be enjoyable. A workaround is to play while in Airplane Mode but no one should have to do that. Also, what am I supposed to do with all the diamonds?! Better instructions please!",1
Ads make it impossible to play,1
👎🏻👎🏻,1
Too many adds. Blatant cash grab.,1
imagine... a youtube video that has ads every oh idk 0.3 seconds? well imagine that but a game,1
"A great shame because I really like playing the game itself, I would have liked to have paid for an ad-free version and also install it for my kids, but instead the game is nothing but adverts with no option to buy.",1
"15 seconds of play followed by 60 seconds of ads, plus you cannot play it you aren't connected to there Internet. WAIST OF TIME!!",1
"Way too little actual play time sprinkled in amongst WAYYYYY too many ads that are 2, 3 or 4 times longer than the play time. Lame, deleted.",1
ads ads ads,1
The game is not that fun where I can have that as an excuse as to why it has so many ads kmt... 2 mins in and am already uninstalling this cr a p,1
Too much ads,1
Far too many adverts,1
Invasive with advertisements. No option to kill ads.,1
"Waaaay too many ads. I know you want to make some money, but do you really have to run ads after every level?",1
Frustrating. Way too many commercials for me to try other apps that I couldn't play the game. I deleted it.,1
"Soooo many ads not much ""game play"".",1
Bd,1
The game is very laggy and all you have to do is pick the biggest number. Every time I run it gets even more glitchy. There are also billions of adds that pop up.,1
15 sec ad every level,1
Forced advertising rather than gameplay completely ruins the point of playing yet fun but crashes when you too many people,1
"Game is good but after every leval thare is a ad, ad, ad, ad........ Worst experians",1
"Just an app to get you to watch countless ads, whatever you do requires an ad to watch.",1
"Absolutely hate the ad wall. Ads in the bottom of the screen, ads between each and every level. All I see is ads and the game mechanics is a bit off. As such, it unfortunately goes to the discard pile 😀",1
"As expected, more time watching ads than playing. Uninstalled after about three minutes.",1
"It's a fun enough mini game, but you will spend more time watching ads than actually playing which ruins the experience.",1
"Tons of ads, every level, if like the same ad over and over to progress...then n is Ok.",1
"Ads after every level is very annoying, deleted the game because of that annoyance.rubbish!",1
"Terrible, way too many ads and this is a new dumb idea to make a new game that is like this! Bad idea, too many ads appear, basically a super easy game that is like one of those games called 'AFK Arena', and a game that is pointless to waste your time for NOTHING and it's just way too easy. It's almost like automatic. Like a level -1 difficulty. Sure, that it's just my opinion but, you can play it weither or not. Your choice. Also, 100% not recommended because it's a WASTE OF YOUR DAMN TIME.",1
"The game managed to make me uninstall it in less than two minutes. Each level takes 15 second, then you have to watch a 30 second ad before the next level.",1
"Decent game, simple and fun. Gets repetitive quickly. Way too many ads. Makes it not worth it. Seriously, don't bother installing this game if you actually want to play. There's an ad after every round, and rounds last 10 seconds. Every part of the game requires you to watch an ad. You can turn off your wifi but you shouldn't have to for a game. Go install something else instead, don't waste your time here.",1
Play a level that last about 5 seconds then watch 2 or 3 30 seconds worth of adds! Would be a good game to past time if you like watching adds,1
"Complete a level, watch an advert, complete a level, watch an advert, complete a level, watch an advert. Only way to play this game is OFFLINE!",1
World top add shows,1
"This game ia not a absolutely terrible, bjit if u watch 30-sec ads every 15 seconds. Whats the point. Gotta uninstalled. I've had it after less than 24 hours.",1
"Too many ads, time spent watching ads is way more than actually playing. Also unnecessarily heavy on the phone, as you get more manpower fps drops substantially. Waste of time.",1
10 secs of gameplay followed by 2 minutes of adverts.,1
Awful just adverts don't download waste of time,1
Horrible. Too many ads. Game action too brief.,1
Adds every 5 seconds,1
The game is really good but the sheer amount of ads is disgusting. I mean I get it developers fotta get paid. But this is just too many ads. Like you play for 5 seconds for a level and 20 seconds ad. Come on.,1
So laggy,1

Ads ever 5 seconds. The game would be fun if the ads weren't so ridiculous.,1
Too many ads! After every level you have to wach one of these unbearable (sometimes even unskippable) mobile game adds with a length of 20+ seconds.,1
Forces a huge number of adds,1
Teking veri taim tu daunlod,1
Game is like 15secs each then you have to watch 30secs ad after each game. Too much.,1
Adds are horrible. Can't get out of them half the time.,1
"Sooooo many FORCED ADS, even with wifi off and permission blocked, pop up censored.",1
loaded with ads,1
You may meet someone else,1
soooooooooooooo many ads,1
80% of the game is watching ads. 😔,1
More ads and also when it intersting it is hanging need to restart then it is coming one thing important is more ads,1
Too. Many. Ads. Probably would've enjoyed the game...uninstall,1
Too many ads.,1
You should put more ads in the game. I didn't download Advertisement simulator. Not even playable.,1
It lags a lot and its just horrible,1
10 sec of game play 60 sec of ads,1
Phone games now a days are just another way to shovel as many ADS as possible at people. Pathetic.,1
💩💩💩💩💩,1
"Cool game, too many ads",1
Do you like ads? The developers sure do! Seriously like after every level it is a 30 sec ad.,1
What the hell is this meant to be.is it a passage out of the person who happens to try this game.it was nothing more than a continuous ADVERT.It was like a slap in the face to try to get through so many of the adverts only to find ANOTHER advert.RUBBISH absolute RUBBISH. 1 STAR is even too good a rating,1
OK game to kill 5 minutes but as per usual you have to watch 20 adds in that time. Once again greedy developers more intrested in supplying adds rather than content.,1
"All they care about is money, not the user. After every mission there's an ad and some ads you can't even X off. I don't recommend downloading.",1
"Every time you win, you have to watch a app video.... NOPE!! You're watching more ads than playing this game!!",1
Every 10 second level requires watching 30+ second ads.,1
I got tired of seeing these ads. I just wanted to download it o give it a 1 star.,1
It will not even let me download it,1
"Could be a fun game, but there's a 30 second ad after every level that very quickly saps the fun. I even got an ad at the start of a level after I upgraded",1
BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING,1
Never download it. So f.... annoying game with huge amount of ADS!!!!,1
This game has to much ads and freezes constantly so please fix this Your Mom,1
Won't let me download,1
Who's time do you live? The only purpose of this waste is to watch advertising for someone else to get paid. The entertainment value here lasts for less than a minute while there's endless ads.,1
To much advertisments: advertisment after each level is too much,1
Ads ads and more ads,1
Deleted because watching 1-2 ads every 20 seconds means there's more ad time than actual game time!,1
Hitash raval I am proud of you,1
"Man, I'm usually unlikely to review but this is so ad heavy, it takes 15 seconds to do the level and 2-5 minutes to finish the ad. Awful. Skip entirely.",1
"Game is fun, but is riddled with a ridiculous amount of ads in game as banners, and after every completed run you are subjected to at least a 30 second ad if not longer. They should have called the game AD Masters. No thank you. Uninstalling.",1
"Despite the reviews warning about ads, I gave it a go. I played through 5 levels, then uninstalled. The game itself has potential, but the 30 second ads after every level plus ads to unlock some rewards simply kills the entire experience.",1
Far too many adverts,1
All it is is watching ads with some playing sometimes,1
So much ads. Good brain game tho.,1
Waaaaaayyyyy to many ads,1
Very Bad,1
Occasionally you get to play a game inbetween watching ads non stop,1
"Forced to watch an ad after every single level you complete, big no no.",1
"For each minute of gameplay, you have 5 showing obligatory ads, not playable! Really, this is a clock bait, not a game!",1
90% watching ads 10% playing the game! Uninstalled as I refuse to watch an ad after every level witch is about every 20 seconds,1
Ads everywhere and not replayable.,1
"Užasno, previše reklama",1
Way too many ads.,1
"Game is so basic, it becomes boring within minutes. Levels are couple seconds long and between levels unreal amount of advertisement material. Definitely more ads watching than actual playing. Uninstalling without regret.",1
Deleted after a few minutes playing way to many adds,1
Too many long ads that can not skip,1
"levels are made extremely short, so they can spam you with ads. The reward system is extremely useless as i played 30 levels without getting anything but 300 coins from those boxes. (why implement a loot box system if there is only one reward?) The boss fights are borring as the only thing that matters are your numbers and you cant contibute to the fight at all, well you can increase your numbers with a last addition where you have to hit the screen at a certain time, which has quite the delay.",1

Too many ads,1
Ads big let down to potential great game I downloaded this app because I found it in the top 10 most downloaded games and had good rating. Sadly after only 20 mins of playing the overkill of ads after every level forced me to uninstall Such a shame. Game could be a lot of fun,1
Doesnt work wont even download...,1
Soooooo many ads. This is not acceptable.,1
Too many ads. One after every stage. No thanks.,1
Loj vk,1
An ad after every level?! PASS!!,1
"Maps are too short and simple to be a challenge, and you're watching more ads than have gameplay. Played up until level 70 in hopes it got better, but there isn't even an increase in difficulty or length. Points you collect seem to be calculated wrongly. 140*5.2 is not 153. Buggy controls, I could go on, but summarized it's an addicting concept which could be fun but the execution makes you wanna uninstall it almost instantly.",1
easy game no challenge.,1
It has privacy policy!!!!!,1
The ad after every level takes longer to play than the level itself. I uninstalled it .,1
Spent more time watching Ads than playing. Zero stars.,1
Too many ads and takes way too long. FYI: there's an ad after completing a level. Each ad is like 30 seconds long.,1
Op game,1
Ads every level,1
1 level 1 advert repeatedly. Completely ruins the game,1
OMG. Potential to be a fun game but there is a 30-second ad after EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Not worth the time. Uninstalled.,1

Good game,1
Too many ads. The game is very uninteresting!!! Nonsense!,1

Boring and way too many ads,1
More ads than gameplay.,1
"It Keeps on freezeing up, it someone to work on it",1

"So many things to complane about 1. TO MANY ADDS! My daughter wanted this game so I downloaded it for her, but when she played it and she only got to play for 10 seconds and then it would give her an add. 2. SO MUCH LAG! You basicly can't play, it lags too much she said she can't even complete a level. Waste of space, I do NOT reccomed this game.",1
Garbage. Advert machine.,1
I don't know that 2 say,1
Are you aware there's a game getting in the way of your ads!!!,1
Waste game I ever seen,1
Stopped working after 2 levels,1
"Game is basically one big ad. Dont download. Fun, but the levels are very short and you get an ad after every level. 50% gameplay 50% ads",1
Its just bad,1
This game is so lag and I am super mad at this game.,1
way too many adds,1
"More adverts than game, garbage",1
Way way way way too many ads,1
Something else in graphics,1
"After every level there is an ad, this is a SCAM",1
It's a worst app,1
"This is an advertising app, not a game. Play for 20 seconds then watch 40 seconds of adverts. Ridiculous!",1
it sucks and verey laggy and iu have full bars and an dgraet wifi and one of the bouns rounds when the big red guy has like a big axe the haethl bar didnt go down at all it suck wrok on it more ou lazy people and my brother is crying because it is laggy so get your lazy butts up and work on it ya actly wrok you dumbies,1
"This is a worst game ever too many ads in this game like hell of them. Better not to instrall this game because of too many ads all time ads like when ever I touch this game its just shows ads like too many ads. Tbh worst game of all time just because of thoes too many ads, like hell of them. #honestreview",1
Do not play. I've tried playing twice and both times the game locked up my phone and forced me to have to restart. There is something seriously wrong with this app.,1
Bad,1
I dont mind a few ads. But after every short round is excessive. The ads are longer than play time.,1
After every level there is a 30 second add. Really impossible to enjoy the game when every level comes with its own Advertising,1
Probably like 2 to 3 ads per minute. No thanks.,1
"Every single time you complete a stage, ""and now a word from our sponsors."" It's not worth it.",1
Long adds,1
Poopoo,1
"Never understand who rates these games highly. Always densely packed with ads. Litterally counted about ads every 5 seconds. No clue who's idea of fun that is, but these games are always exploitative like no other.",1
"It's fine, but there is occasional gameplay in between the ads. I'm just sitting there watching ads, then I have to play through a small level",1
Poop,1
Stuffed with too many ads.,1
Would you like a side of game with your app dedicated to ads? Terrible.,1
Ads last longer then actual game play,1
Ad every 10 seconds. unplayable.,1
Fun...if you want to spend 75% of your time watching ads.,1
"If you love watching ad's this is for you, want to play a game you won't find it here!",1
Terrible! Could be a great game but ADS EVERY TIME YOU FINISH A ROUND. Don't recommend at all,1
No good,1
Very bad game so time to download snd not run without net plzz fix it ⌚,1
The ads are ridiculous!!! I've had an account that disables ads..... guess what? I still got them (prob illegal).... we need to get these kind of games band off the playstore (disgraceful).,1
Unplayable too many ads!!!!,1
Hey everayone CLEARLY THESE DEVELOPERS ISNT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE BLUDY ADD THEY DONT EVEN RESPOND SO I THINK THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS DELETE THIS GAME i play MOB CONTROL ASWELL AND THAT IS WAY BETER IM NOT SURE IF ITS THE SAME DEVELOPER BUT ITS WAY BETER you dont even deserve this 1 star but i had no coice,1
Ok game,1
"Main, and huge problem: The amount of ads it displays lol One round of the game takes around 10-20sec, and at the end of EVERY round you get an ad that will display for 30seconds if you dont press the small skip button. Very simple visual, runs light. There's no mechanics apart from moving the finger left and right... And there's no difficulty at all.",1
This game sucks. Trust me.,1
Seriously.. an ad after each time you play? *Delete* no balance at all.,1
Too many ads. I understand that you need ads. But every single level even the first one? No. The levels last like 10-20 seconds. No one needs an ad every 10 seconds. At least you're honest about it and start right on the first level rather than faking for a bit then doing it every level. But still too much. App deleted.,1
"They should just call this game, ""Ads, ads, ads"". Uninstall!",1
F*** this game it keeps asking me if I want to watch ads I don't want to and I press no I would like to go somewhere else it gives me the ads anyway stop giving me ads,1
waste of time 👎,1
What a waste of time,1
rolling adverts that sometimes let you play the game.,1
YALL BASICALLY COPIED JOIN AND CLASH!,1
Too many ads to enjoy the game.,1
Too much ads,1
"Do not download. As soon as this app installs it immediately begins harvesting your information, even before you have opened it. It's only because I had a network monitoring tool that I caught it. Just in the few seconds it took me to block it on a slow 4g connection, it sent 28 mb.",1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP! It downloads the apps they show on ads without your consent, keep your phone safe.",1
"It's a nice idea but it's really impossible to play it: ads, ads and then even more ads! You can pay to remove them but I consider it too expensive comparing to similar games.",1
If you want to watch adverts... all the time... go for it.,1
👎👎👎👎👎,1
Had enough after just 5mins of playing as you are forced to watch an advert after every. Single. Level!! Uninstalled.,1
too many ads without an opportunity to buy an ad-free experience,1
Every 15 seconds of game play you HAVE to watch a full add. It's literally more add then game... Not worth the time.,1
Eot,1
"Too many intrusive ads. After every level, after every click. No thanks.",1
Too many ads,1
Really!?! That ad must have been 2 mintues! I clicked to get my nav bar up Ad opens in chrome. Garbage game and garbage product in the ads. This many one stars should boot the game from the store.,1
garbage too much ads,1
I really have not played this game.But I think it's gonna be fun.,1
You're dealing with ads more than playing the actual game. Not worth it.,1
"So so so many ads, also not that fun",1
Bad,1
S**ty gameplay with more adds than fun,1
Your game trash this is the time i play bad game,1
Count Masters,1
It makes a game really fun with a unskippable 2 minute ad between EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. Not even a ad free version.,1
To many ads,1
"I HATE IT WHEN YOU GET RANDOM COULOR'S FOR MY AVITAR IN THIS GAME! I JUST WANT TO DESIGN MY OWN AVITAR!!! OH AND ALSO WHEN I GET TO A BOSS BATTLE WHY THE HELL IS ""10"" BIGGER THEN ""40"" AND,""WHY IS ""80"" THE SMALLEST"" also I want more different people, And There Is ""WAY"" too many Ads. And I also wat hat accessories for my Avitar, and the levels are too hard.",1
Ads after each level?,1
Bfffsas,1
Far too much ads,1
Одна реклама,1
Levels are repetitive and short. You'll spend more time on ads than gameplay.,1
"Doesn't go anywhere, doesn't get harder, can't do anythingnwith the coins you collect. Pathetic game",1
Just a bad game,1
"More ads than gameplay, and ads during gameplay",1
"Would like to give 0 stars. I do realize developers live from advertisment, but in this game it's constantly going to ads. Repetitve gameplay plus advertisment is just not worth the time.",1
Adds adds adds adds adds...... You got the point.,1
The amount of ads JUST to play the game is horrendous. Just unplayable.,1
Too many ads.,1
Absolutely bad,1
Too many ads.,1
Fun game but waaaaaaay too many adverts,1
"No envolvement. Just straight up ads. Ads in the bottom, ads after every level, and no skill required. Rename this to ""give the dev some ad money while you waste your time watching ads for stupid games""",1
Best game,1
Koci igrica,1
Ads!!!!!,1
Too much ads,1
10 seconds of play and then watch a few minutes of ads. I got sick of watching ads before I could even figure out if the game was fun and uninstalled,1
To much adds if you can't get money so you put 9999 adds ppl will ahte your game so get a good job that WILL make ppl happy,1
Too many ads,1
"Too easy, kinda enjoyed playing when bored but uninstalled as there is an ad after every level passed. Not worth playing",1
It would be much better with even more ads. I should be watching at least 2 minutes of ads per 10 seconds of game play.,1
An add in between every single game... Annoying AF,1
Ads after every round. 0/10 not worth your time,1
A lot of ads,1
Ad after every level makes this game unplayable.,1
5 seconds of gameplay followed by 10 to 20 seconds of ads.,1
"Don't waste your time. 30 seconds worth of ads after every single level (which take all of 10 seconds to complete) is really great. /s Even despite that, the game is just stupid.",1
I hate this app because it is so boring all you do is collect more people and then die.,1
"Más anuncios que juego, una chota.",1
"Terrible experience. You play 10 seconds, you get 2 minutes of ads. I understand that the ads are necessary to keep up the game, but forcing the users to see 3 ads every game, it's just ridiculous. Save yourself some time and don't install it at all. It's not worthy it.",1
"Ads after only 10 seconds, not worth it.",1
Ruined by ads as others have said it makes a fun mess about game absolutely terrible if you could give 0 stars I would have,1
I REMOVED THIS FROM MY PHONE within 5 minutes. I just wanted the loser game developer know that. You ruined it with the ads and it was overall a very boring game.,1
"Short levels long ads yeah... But on my phone I have to swipe up to go to home, and the ads at the bottom don't bring you to a page bug AUTOMATICALLY START DOWNLOADING THE APP. Also literally don't know how such a simple game is too much for my device. Oh wait I do know, it's a cash grab so you didn't check what devices it'd actually be compatible for :|",1
Literally 80% of the game is watching ads very unfortunate,1
Like the game. Way to many ads. Give me an option to buy work no ads.,1
A trash,1
This game is very rubbish and a waste of time because of the time wasted on this rubbish I would review it p stars but that is not an option worst game I have ever experienced in 45 years,1
"4 ads in my first level. I get that ads is how you make money but come on, a level takes less than 20 seconds and its followed by 4 second ads?",1
To many ads,1
Tooooo many ads,1
Too many ads,1
Too many ads. Gets old real quick,1

"Each round is shorter than the set of ads that okay after each round. I fully support Devs earning income through ads, but not when watching them is 70% of the games experience.",1
Too many ads,1
"Too many ads for each level, horrible thing is it's going to ad portal even in offline mode.",1
TOOOOOOOOOOO MANY ADDS 👎,1
Too many ads. 2 min ad after every 15 second level. Had to Uninstall. Game is not enjoyable at all.,1
Your game is a disgrace to all games on the app store!,1
This is just a game of ads. Absolutely horrible. 10 seconds of gameplay followed by 2 minute ads. Do not download.,1
Too mush adds,1
Too many ads,1
So many ads...,1
If there target market is a 5year old it might be a little challanging for them....even then they will unistall because of the amout of ads.....not challanging for anyone really and to many ads.....this game needs rethinking....,1
Doesnt let you skip their 30 second ads,1
More time watching ads than playing the game. Get the balance right already.,1
"Play for 15 seconds, watch an ad for 30 seconds, play for 15 seconds watch an ad for 30 seconds, etc etc. Not exaggerating.",1
too many ads,1
Every 10 seconds another add it sucks,1
"This game literally is just adware. By this I mean, after every single level you complete you're served a ad. This is annoying and bad design, the user should always have the choice to view ads for things, it shouldn't be forced.",1
Lame,1
Ads.,1
"Second ""boss"" my guys get locked off screen and I can neither damage him or take damage from him basically game locked in stalemate. Tried multiple times, same thing happens every time",1
Shum kot,1
So bad game of world play Battleground mobile India,1
"For every ten seconds of playing, you have to watch at least one minute of ads",1
You'll spend more time watching adverts than playing the game......avoid!,1
Ads ads ads!! Each round takes about 15 seconds and then you have to watch a 30 second ad!! Only got to round 4 and I'm deleting!,1
Too many ads,1

Good,1
Too many ads,1
Every level is followed by a solid minute of ads,1
Too much adds worst this thing,1
Far too many ads,1
So 👎,1
Too many back to back ads. Play time is a fraction of the time spent watching ads. Don't even bother downloading.,1
"This is an app that just shows you ads constantly, and once in a while you play a 10 second minigame.",1
Way toooooo many adds,1
Nice Game,1
It is absolutely pathetic how many ads are in this game. 10 seconds of play and then a 30 second ad. You've guaranteed I will never use any of the products that keep popping up in ads,1
There's an ad after every damn level. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game,1
"This game is extremely bad, full of ads and constant crashes.",1
Good,1
It's just advertising with a little game in between each video. Don't install this!,1
Got an ad before I even played the first level? Instant uninstall,1
I'm sick of watching ads again n again,1
Ads,1
Good concept but more time spent watching ads than actually playing,1
This game is 99 percent ads and 1 percent game play. Don't bother.,1
Ads ads ads,1
I agree with all the bad reviews. Pointless. A splash of colour in the middle of a never ending ad.,1
Metanse las 800 publicidades por segundo en el orto... Injugable,1
"Spend more time watching adverts than playing the game. Not an exaggeration. Levels are short, ads are long. Don't bother.",1
More ads than gameplay.,1
You spend more time in ads than in the game,1
It sucks,1
Worst game ever 🤢,1
Worst game ever,1
Super glitchy,1
No level select is one of the worst trends I've seen in modern marketing and this game is no exception,1
"A level takes about 15 sec to complete. It's followed by a 30 sec advert. After every single level. Basically you download an advertisement app where advertisements are sometimes interrupted by short games. Uninstalled, incredibly annoying",1
"The game itself is fun but the fact that there's an ad after every play and the ad lasts 18-60 seconds and the game is only 16 seconds long, it's more of an adds app and not much play. I give it 2 thumbs WAY down👎👎",1
Bruh the ad literally breaks my game and I can't get off it without closing the game I'm playing fix this,1
Way to many ads and not really that enjoyable for such a simple concept,1
Cringe,1
Too many ads.,1
"Awful, could be a good game but an ad after every level. No thanks",1
Full of ads,1
"Many adds and text and ""next level"" buttons.... I prefer fast open & play games",1
Doesn't support my phone Samsung A2 core,1
Many adds,1
"Play for 10 seconds, watch a 30 second advertisement, repeat.",1
"Should be advertised as watching ads, not playing a game.",1
😭,1
Adds after every level and made my phone run super warm even tho this game should not be able to do that,1
I thought this game would be fun all it does is lags the first 30 seconds I got tired of it.do not install this is a waist of time all I does is lags and every end of the game there is a ADD. do not installthis sucks🤭1 star for trying. But this game sucks,1
"Too many ads. I got it, to make money is good. But let's find other ways of doing it",1
"Parece que la app es solo para ver publicidad, tiene más tiempo de anuncios que de juego al finalizar el nivel, juegas 5 seg y tienes que ver 30 de anuncios mínimo algunos no te deja hacer skip, la verdad no vale la pena",1
Too many ads. More than 60% of the play time are adds.,1
Good game but to many adverts I has to uninstall it,1
Ads to much agressive,1
"Ridiculous amount of ads, one after every level. The level is 10seconds then a 30second ad",1
"Ads ads ads ads may as well name this game ads no fun I would rate this a zero if I could, at least let me play 2 levels without getting 1 add do not recommend at all ,also very boring",1
Amongus gusus Rs,1
Worst game too much ads,1
so in a nutshell all you do is remember what you were taught in 3rd grade go on a add marathon and boom lvl 1 completed. the worst part is that you can't even rate this game 0 stars,1
Very very bad game😰😰😰😰😰😰😰🚌💨💨💨🏃😂 Missed a bus!,1
"Ads, way too many ads",1
All ads game is trasu,1
"Waaay to many ads, made it to were I couldn't enjoy the game knowing I'm gunna get about 20 seconds of game time then get hit with another 30 sec ad. Not worth my time",1
Awful game,1
You have a good time in town now but will look forward and 7th 2.54 joining.,1

Too many adverts,1
"Game is freezing up. Tried different networks , updayed, no charge.",1
"Dont install... no privacy , too much adds after a little play",1
Far far too many adds for a very mediocre game. Really dont bother.,1
"Ads, ads, ads and more ads. And then more ads. Could have been a fun [WAIT here is another ad]",1
Horrific ads,1
My child can't play because are not opening please help,1
"Ads watcher: the game. I can accept watching ads to play a free game, but the rate was far too insane",1
Every single time an ad. U spend more time watching crypto ads then playing.... Sorry,1
"Games unplayable because of ads. Would be fairly good and enjoyable, but most levels you finish on around 30 seconds and after EVERY one of them, there double ads",1
"Terrible,just terrible ads ads ads ads on and on to many ads,when you get a reward it tells you if you want to get a other reward just by watching a ad but if you put skip you watch a ad but you get nothing so there is no point by skipping if you watch a ad neither way.DO NOT DOWNLOAD this is the worst game i ever played.piece of garbage 🗑. I would rather play nothing than playing this.",1
Veeeeeeeeery annoying.,1
"The game have a good potential, with every single move you take come with an ad makes it impossible to play it",1
Muy mal optimizado,1
Ads... ads... ads every time you finish a stage... aka every 10 seconds a 30 second add comes up,1

Sooo laggy and sensitive it makes you pick the wrong option then makes you watch an ad after you die because of lag,1
Graphics is not good,1
Completely stupid. Don't waste your time.,1
Haven't done anything more useless than trying out this game. Pointless,1
wow they were right about the ads that was ridiculous,1
Slow loading,1
Ads simulators,1
Lot of ads uninstalling,1
"I should of read reviews earlier, uninstalling because of massive ad overload,",1
Irritating exoerience with ads after each level,1
Stop playing and deleted after 3 levels. I can't take that there is a full ad after every level.,1
Ads time is equal to or more than the play time. Deleting! Annoying game!,1
99% adds. Not worth it,1
Ads,1
"This is a terrible game don't download it. It's just ads every time you do anything. The levels are short, the art style is ugly, and you can't actually dodge 90% of the obstacles so you just lose half your crowd no matter what you do.",1
Yez,1
This is a good game if you enjoy watching endless ads,1
They like to chop too much,1
The amount of ads in this game is astonishing,1
Its Laggy and buggy legit unplayable,1
Seems fun but ad after every level and no way to get rid of ads,1

It didn't let me download it,1
"Sooo many Ads... Literally, it's 30 seconds of game play, 20 seconds of ads, then rinse and repeat. I understand the need for ads, and don't mind them. But spending nearly just as much time in ads as the game? Yeah, no thank you. Instant Uninstall.",1

A add every 15 seconds is a bit much. How can anyone enjoy a game when it's constant adds?,1
Too many ads,1
There is an ad after every single level. Makes playing just tedious. Spread it out alittle.,1
Far toooo many ads to enjoy the game,1
Too Adds,1
"It's just ads, literally there's limited to no gameplay.",1
"Too many ads!!, deleted it after an hour.",1
Like the game but not worth the amount of ads,1
Spend more time forced to watch adverts than playing the game. Deleted.,1
"After the first level it requires an internet connection in order to continue playing. This is not offline, remove the tag that says offline you f",1
Too much ads 😥 it's so annoying and the gameplay is so bad I would rather play fortnite which is still a bad game,1
Fun but ads are way too much,1
ليس راعن جدا😞,1
"whoever made this, it's so annoying. it cant proceed to next level. click bait! 😠😡😤",1
Such a shame. Good game but completely ruined by adverts.,1
Stupid game. Plays ad after each level. Not fun at all. Wouldn't recommend at all.,1
Doesn't load all the time and when it does it shuts off. Decent game if I could play it,1
The ads are ridiculous.,1
Slow and wayyyyyy too many ads.,1

"Cool concept , gets boring too quickly, ads , ads 🙄 , not worth it",1
Too many ads,1
"Ads after every short level. Annoying, and not even a 10 second play at the most. The developer is raking in affiliate revenue based on short play, and toooooo many ads. Uninstalling.",1
ಠ_ಠ,1
Game play is fine. But the number of adds is ridiculous.,1
Hope you like ads,1
Good game i play then feel better,1
This game is to easy but every level there's a 30 second add If developer of game sees it get rid of adds Just play clash royal Or clash of clans it's way better,1

Too much ads... Very boring,1
Too much adv,1
Too many adverts,1
More ads than game.,1
"To many adverts, unplayable",1
Mildly entertaining for roughly 10 minutes before you note the high number of ads and increasingly dull and repetitive levels. Game goes nowhere and ads are stultifying.,1
"I have no problem watching commercials to play games. But, any game that tries to make you watch this many commercials,,, had better be way better!",1

Trash,1
Terrible the game is literally just ads,1

"About twice as much time watching ads as playing and full of annoying gimicks, coins and gems and things to encourage you to pay stupid money.",1
Muchísima publicidad re molesta,1
Boring one dimensional game that is simply an ad farm. Don't waste your time.,1
Paki ayus naman kada tapos ng isang game puro ads,1
"I get free games need ads to support but this takes the crunch. Game, Ad Game, Ad, Game, Ad. Level is over in less than 30 sec Ads are 30 sec. More time spent watch ads than playing game. If you like watching ads then this is your game. If you want a quick time killer then dont look at this.",1

This game is absolutely horrible the game is so repetetive you get bored in five minutes not to mention the game lagged do hard it basically completely stopped on LEVEL 2!!! THERE IS NO SITUATION WHERE YOUR GAME SHOULD FREEZE ON LEVEL 2! The game is so boring that you'll want to Chuck your phone say the wall on LEVEL 5 so please do yourself a favor and choose a different game,1
"The ads are longer than the levels, they're unskippable, and the levels aren't even fun. Don't bother!",1
Ad pusher,1
"Unless junk. Each level is just two arithmetic operations which you do in 10 seconds followed by an unskipable ad of 30 seconds. Then, it is laggy.",1
Its an add grinder,1
"Levels are really short, ads after every game, its overall a pretty boring game. The 5 star reviews are either bots or anybody under the age of 10. I'm sorry but you have to make the game better and have less ads.",1
Kanker spel,1
There is a level that gets me out of the game,1
Useless due to all the advertisments they place,1
"These ads are WAAYYYY to intrusive. They make it seem like you have the option of watching an ad for a bonus reward, but really you're going to watch the ad anyway :/. Also I turned my sound off on the game so why would I want it for the ads? Garbo",1
"Just ad farm, not worth it",1
30 secs ad for 5 secs gameplay. Uninstalled after 10 minutes playing.,1
"After being bombarded on tik tok by these ads. Showing the game being played by fools and then "" oh no I couldn't make it past level this it's too hard"" I finally cracked and played only to be greeted by 19x the amount of ads any human can stand. And oh to my surprise(not) the game is trash. Stop spreading your ads for this, use the money you made you greedy Corp and build something worth peoples time. You're obviously not stupid if you managed to get this ad maker 10000 at 3rd spot. So do it.",1
No Ad Free version. I would pay to have this game ad free. There are way to many ads!,1
Toooooo many ads. 15 secs gameplay = 30 secs ads.,1
5o many ads to make it worth installing,1
Stupid ads... very bad gaming experience.,1
Has too much adds is so boring it glitches and I recoun mend that people should not download it it's so boring uh,1
I like the game but it has lot of ads so please off the net and play. Thanks,1
Insane amount of Ads,1
Terrible game would not recommend shooting many ads,1
Worse game,1
So much ad I delet It after 5 min of playing,1
play 1 round followed by a 30 second ad everytime,1
"Game is allright, but the ads are annoying and too often",1
"Fun enough to pass 10 mins, but literally 6 of those 10 minutes will be ads",1
Tatti game,1
The ad spam is out of control. Few seconds of game followed by 10-30 seconds of ads. Rinse repeat. Don't waste your time.,1
There are so many ads in the this game. You spend more time watching ads than actually playing it. I know that costs need to match the revenue but this is over kill,1
This game just has way too much and it just pops up every single time but in other words at nice,1
You watch ads probably 5x more than you play then game. It's unbearable. Uninstalled after 5 minutes.,1
The ads take longer to get through than the game itself. Absolute waste of time.,1
Too many adds,1
This is an annoying game. There are alot of ads so it makes it boring. Moving the characters in this game is annoying because they do what they want to do so you don't have a say in what they do and what amount of characters you get. I would highly recommend not to download this game,1
4 3,1
Great for retarders or under 6y. Hard to lose.,1
jy,1
Game is ruined by far to many ads.,1
"Ads after every level, don't download. rubbish.",1
10 seconds of game play then stuck with 45 second ad. It's unbearable to play with this ratio.,1
"This game is very boring with the same concept the whole way through, and with a ridiculous amount of ads. I do NOT recommend this stupid ""game"" to anyone. I hope that the developers feel ashamed of themselves for making such a revolting game.",1
Too much of adds,1
No instalen es dolor de cabeza totalmente .despues de cada jugada hay publicidad de 30 segundos k vuelve loco .y no hay manera de evitar lo .absurdo juego,1
"All the enjoyment you get from this game, is sucked out by the obsessive ads. Your gameplay lasts about 10-15 seconds and then you're forced watch at least 30 seconds of ads, sometimes more because they play 2-3 back to back. Seriously, unless you get enjoyment from watching the same adverts over and over again, stay well away from this dumpster fire",1
More ad time than game time.,1
Its boring,1
2 Ads after every run,1
"Very laggy, also gets boring",1
"I don't understand how there are only 15 ratings shown for this game! Barely playable, way too many ads. The ads last longer than the levels.",1
Cheap game with too many ads.,1
"I understand ads are used for revenue, but after EVERY round....Come on!! I like they do have a no ads upgrade but $10??? No thank you.",1
Lots of ads irretating me during play this game,1
"Pathtic , doesn't change level",1
Its just ads. Don't bother.,1
Game ad game ad game ad.. Every ge there's an ad,1
Time waster with not enough to offer,1
Way too many ads and all you do is swipe left or right its too easy,1
Pure Cr&p,1
20 seconds of game play and 40 seconds of ad that hijacks your whole screen. Best ad delivery system. Recommend space for advertising.,1
Horrific adverts you can't easily get away from. No point in playing due to that.,1
Ads Ads Ads More Ads,1
terrible! I cant ven find words to describe how a it was,1
Mind numbingly boring! It's far too easy which makes it sooooooooo boring!,1
"Too many ads, levels are too short.",1
Too many ads,1
More ads than game.,1
It's scary how bad this game is,1
"Just another add generator with incredibly dumb levels, honestly this game is so simple.",1
Shame.. it has a potential,1
No jokes the ads destroy this game.,1
Every single level ends with an end. You will literally spend more time watching ads than playing the game.,1
This game is too repetitive. Every level feels essentially the same. Because I played it offline I didn't have the problem with ads as the other reviews are saying.,1
Another half decent game wrecked by ads. Just stop!,1
Repetitive levels and a ridiculous amount of adds in between each level.,1
Had to deleted because of too many Ads after every 10 second level,1
The ads freeze everthing up,1
Too much of ad's,1
Ads ads ads. Uninstalled.,1
Too many ads.,1
More ads than game.,1
Way too many ads 🙄,1
"keeps stopping, ads are slow, always have to reboot HELP",1
To many in game ads. One once in awhile is fine but after every level. You don't even get to play the game. You spend 80% of the time waiting for ads to finish.,1
"Worst app..Purely advertisements..Nothing else..For every touch,there is an add",1
Worst game many more ad's,1
So many unskippable video ads I had to uninstall after 3 levels.,1
Waaaay too many ads.,1
Not good it smells,1
Ads only,1
Buggy and ad filled,1
Ridiculous amount of ads,1
Only adds,1
This game is terrible 😭 the ads keep on bothering me and glitching is annoying I like the game I just don't like the service,1
good,1
Too many ads. It could be my fave game without it,1
A ridiculous amount of ads,1
what a waste of time. ads every minute and all levels repeat the same tricks.,1
👍Nice idea but 👎power hungry and 👎pub shower.😢,1
"Ditto. Great game, but unplayable with the excessive ads.",1
Impossible to play with so many adds!,1
Ads after every round even after the first one,1
80% ads. 20% stupid game,1
Too many ads Hi dev I'll buy this game of you,1
"Yes the ads are the worst, but can be fixed by turning off data. My problem is this game gets old quick. What is the end goal, what are the diamonds for after I finish building my tiny city. And why doesn't the game become more difficult. It's an ok time waster, but isn't enough of a challenge.",1
Does this game EVER get challenging? I'm on level 94 and have never once lost a life. I have also completed all the zone attack challenges. Needs to be more difficult,1
Too much ads,1
agly,1
Hohoho the game has so many ad and not so fun,1
Too many ads!!!,1
I like this game but something is missing out that needs to be in the game they give the other people weapons and that not fair,1
too much ads,1
It is good game,1
Games is kind of fun in a time killer way. It's always freezing or glitching. I've lost out on over 3000 diamonds with videos not loading but then ads appear just after. And if you like ads then this is the games for you. Everything takes ads to do. I'll wait for an update to fix but won't hold my breath. May end up deleting.,1
Please,1
To much ads,1
Far far too many adverts like a ridiculous amount. Unplayable every time you die a 30 second advert appears,1
Adpocalypse,1
"Fun BUT glitches, won't allow you to claim prizes or skins. Far too many ads that ALSO freeze and cannot × out of.",1
Don't bother downloading. Garbage game. Gets old so quick and they force you to watch ads after every round which is about 10 seconds. The ads are longer than the actual play time.,1
Horrible,1
Hot garbage. Ten seconds of gameplay followed by 60 seconds of adverts.,1
There is no any endless mode or anything,1
ADS,1
Too many ads make me to uninstall it😬😬,1
Yiu play 4 seconds of the game to watch 2 mins of ads horrible,1
"These guys don't seem to make fun games if u ask me, kinda boring",1
Too many ads....,1
As all other reviews - way too many ads,1
Dont play this game I uninstalled after 15 min i play,1
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢,1
"By installing this game , first You download an advertisement app(the game itself) which sometimes you find a small chance between outnumbered ads to play a very very short and fast stage of game which is compatible for kids under 12 , to make it short , its an app to show kids some advertisement😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐",1
I cant believe i my time downloding this stupid game but here's a tip to Stop the adds turn on aeroplane mode or switch off your WIFI,1
Too many adds,1
Too many ads.,1
Modern mobile games make me lose faith in humanity,1
"Way too many ads. One after every run.... Too many, played 3 runs watched three ads and deleted it. 👎 Every run is what maybe at most 30 seconds?? The commercial is roughly 15??? 30%+ of the game is watching ads...",1
"Ad to play ratio is HORRIBLE!! I get it, you need to put in ads. However, when a level is completed in 5 seconds, but then you force me watch a 30 second ad, every time, that's too much.",1
"Best game to watch a million adverts in no time at all, absolutely shocking 👎",1
It's a very basic game that gets old due to the amount of adds,1
Do many ads,1
To many ads,1
So boring,1
Puku,1
Too many adverts.,1
"Game never gets remotely challenging, and its clear they cap how many people you can have at once with completely unavoidable traps. Absurd amount of ads.",1
I played 7 levels and honestly you spend more time watching the ads than playing. Unfortunately I will be uninstalling the game less than 10 minutes after I loaded it. Game is OK but can't comment as haven't had the chance to see much of it.,1
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄,1
It's bad,1
"Or originally looked like an easy game to play on the go, but once you do the 1st round the adds wont stop!!!! You need to watch the whole thing majority of the time. And then of there's a tinnyyyy ""x"" to skip but If you miss click it still brings you right to the add link or directly to the app store. 🤦🏽‍♀️I downloaded this while on the train like 7 minutes ago and I'm already deleting, Don't bother.",1
Ads every 20 seconds,1
So. Many. Ads. Uninstalled because it takes so long to watch the ads after every interaction... Boooooo.,1
The ad's are pathetic,1
"Great concept but the fact I have to watch an ad after every stage kills it for me ,it'd be cool if it was one after 2-3 stages but the way it is now gets old real fast . Couldn't take more than 10 mins playing as is . Shame",1
0 0 0 0 It BAD ... 0,1
Ridiculous amount of ads. I know free games have ads to get their income but this game you get bombarded with ads after every 10 seconds of gameplay.,1
"If you are searching for a free bilboard with ads, you are in the right place!! And btw there is also a 5 second level between each 20 second ad! Played it exactly 30 minutes (for 10 minutes, the 20 minutes extra was the adds)",1
Ad every single level!!!!,1
Unplayable with ads,1
What a joke?,1
Way too many adverts,1
It is not a game it is just ads,1
Very bad,1
"Levels are too short I spend more time watching coins than I do playing No matter how big you get, half of the board is covered with danger and always stops you from being good at thus game",1
Ad after every level. Very annoying.,1
Too many ads spoil the app. Sorry,1
Hh,1
Stupid game,1
Don't download very boring🤞,1
Over and over and over and more over ads 😂 . I can't play two levels without watching ads and sometimes i watch two ads among them.,1
Too much ad otherwise it's awesome,1
Sounds in ads even on silent.,1
"Too many ads. Could be fun, but every action triggers an ad.",1
"Ads killed it for me, so, I just uninstalled it. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you love the ads more than the game.",1
"Game play isn't bad but there's literally an add after every level, an add to upgrade your guys, an add to even think about playing the game",1
Noob,1
"Way to many ads, every level",1
Level of adds after every level is insufferable!,1
The ads are literally longer than my play time.,1
One of the worst games I played,1
Glitches way too much and the movement is too sensitive. Stop running so many ads through the system and it'll work better.,1
Ads after every level.,1
"'Watch ads, the game'",1
No No Noooooooooo😡,1
For every 25 seconds of actual game play you have to sit through 1min of ads,1
Disgusting,1
"Was a fun game for 30 seconds but excessively high number of adverts, far too many which has taken the fun out of it and reason I have deleted the app",1
"Far too glitchy, screen freeze ups and lock up causing a very poor game play experience. Game is good but very frustrating that you have to sort out restarts.Will be deleting game",1
Ttt Guklh,1
just giving you another 1 star rating for the ads lol,1
Hahahahahaha,1
Too much ad,1
Ads,1
too much add lol,1
Bad,1
"ADs, ADs & more ADs. EVEN If you DONT want the extra bonus...YOU'LL STILL WATCH THE AD LMFAO",1
To many ads. And the ads are noisy and invasive.,1
Such a shame short sighted developers.. enjoyed for 2 min but its true what everyone says .. Ads are brutal . I'd have played daily with less Ads .uninstalled,1
"If you're going to make a game like this, fine. But please don't flood people with ads for your game if you're going to make such trash.",1
Adverts adverts adverts game is 1% game rest advertising scams,1
Not much to do afterwards. It's fun at the beginning as you aquire new skins and conquer land. But the levels end up getting repetitive and there's not much else to do once you complete the map. I don't even know what the diamonds are for. There's also way too many ads. I understand that developers need to make money but the amount of ads are ridiculous.,1
Too many adds,1
One big adfarm No skill required to beat the levels: worst game i have played,1
I had to change my review as i dont like a bit the latest version. Why in the world you have to add another game it was so unnecessary,1
💩,1
This game is sucks,1
It is just an advert haven! You don't get a full game without atleast 2 adverts. Uninstalled.,1
15 second for each round of play and 60 seconds of ads unskippable between every round. Not worth free.,1
wot bak a nava game,1
"Too many adverts. It stated that there were in app purchases. There was no shop and no way to turn the ads off, so I quickly uninstalled it.",1
Far too many adds,1
This is horrible,1
"Over 200 people and it freezes and lags to the point of restart, after 5 levels I've had enough this game sucks",1
I just downloaded this game. So when I FIRST TRIED MY VERY FIRST GAME my characters won't even attack the enemies and I had to download it and I had to delete games which is BS,1
Way too many adds. Not worth downloading.,1
it sucks so much i be tryin to get more people but those spikes keep killin them its just no do not play its the worst you welcome.,1
"The amount of ads, especially obtrusive, is shocking. Literally every button tap leads to an ad",1
Very terrible game. Too many ads ruin it,1
"Pathetic game you get to see ads on every click, doesn't matter if you are midway in the game a touch on your screen and you get to see an ad. Had this installed for a total of 5 mins.",1
There's too many ads and it's like constantly stopping me from even playing one game without an ad.,1
Worst,1
It's pointless ads after every lvl no matter what your guaranteed to lose half of you guys because of traps mainly and it's just all around boring,1
Adds ruin it,1
Very bacar game,1
The game lags way to much to the point where you lose a lot of the little characters,1
its not a good game dont dowload it,1
Turn off wifi and data before launching this app.,1
Ad between every round. Annoying as hell after just 3 rounds. Uninstalled immediately.,1
Ads ads and more ads...,1
Boooringgggggggg,1
Terrible game very laggy,1
To many ads. Way to sensitive for the controls,1
Way too many ads!!,1
Ad after every level. Ridiculous,1
Too many ads,1
The ads take longer than the game.,1
"Ads, Ads, and more Ads. Avoid this game like the plague!",1
Way too much ads,1
Ads suck great game but too many ads,1
Too many ads and buggy as well as levels are short,1
Death by ads. Google play needs to figure out a way to filter these spammy ad generators out. Do not download this game.,1
I dont know what this app is doing in the background or while playing it (foreground) but it uses a lot of data (download / upload). App is suspicious. Download at own risk.,1
"Play for 10 seconds then you get forced to watch 30 second advert, total waste of bandwidth and time",1
Ads after everything you do,1
To many adds,1
Completely unacceptable ratio of gameplay to ad time. Each level is incredibly short. You spend most of the time just watching ads.,1
"This game is just an ad grab. The levels are super short and impossible to lose (seriously, I tried).",1
To many ads.. Really,1
Bad game steals mony from your bank,1
Too much ads!!!!!,1
Don't bother... Decent enough game but the ads are just too much... Uninstalled after a few levels,1
This game is not hard or that fun and they play an ad every 10 seconds. Garbage,1
Worst game in the world Because it kept on kicking me out,1
To many ads,1
هذه اسمها لعبة الاعلانات,1
"Noring Has this game for 10 minutes. 7 of those minutes are as arts. Adverts play longer than the levels of the game. Obstacles are to close together and the path isnt wide enough, get more men they are gone straight away. 0 stars if possible. ADVERTS RUIN GAMES Ergo, you get a bad review and score",1
Too many ads and monotonous,1
Super laggy and too many ads,1
I enjoy the game but I play 10seconds to get 60 seconds of ads. No thanks,1
Too many ads after every level,1
Advert after every level. Deleted.,1
Too much ads,1
Like no game play at all,1
Poor Game,1
Ads are acceptable in free games. But in this game you spend more time watching ads than actually playing the game. Concept was nice though.,1
After each play (10-20 seconds) you get an add. So be carefull. You will mostly watch adds,1
This advert app has a game hidden somewhere. Not good enough to justify more add time than game play.,1
They accidentally put a game inbetween their ads,1
Lots of ad,1
"The game I just a cheap way of whoever made it to make a quick buck by force feeding, the user, ads every 15 seconds. It actually seemed interesting until 10 minutes later you notice that it's impossible to lose a round because it wasn't made to be challenging",1
An ad after Every 8 second level,1
Ads after every round. Jeeze. Talk about an ad money grab game. No thanks.,1
Too many ads!!!!!,1
"While the actual game might be ok, but for ~15 seconds actual play time (that's how long one level last) you must watch 30 seconds ad. Literally. Every level every time.",1
"Level takes 10 seconds to complete, after every level 30 second ad, disaster! This isnt a game its watching ads with a 10 second break. Also, many lags.",1
ADS.... ADS... ADS....,1
Goldigger app,1
Wg,1
game sucks,1
Garbage,1
5 mins of game play and a million minutes of ads every 10 seconds. Im over exaggerating but its annoying!,1
"Sucks, boring, trash",1
Wow,1
It show us many ads,1
Ads after 5 seconds of play.. garbage,1
"This game should be called ""Glitch Fest"" because I got through to the 3rd run, I have a demonstrably outsized advantage and the game just stops, I don't mean to say that the game freezes up, no, because the dividers are still spinning, all of the characters feet are still moving but not going anywhere, it just stops moving, my pile of little people against their little pile of people, facing each other and just glitching out in front of my eyes and nothing to do but disable the game, unimstall",1
Love the game but entirely too many ad's it ridiculous the amount of ads if it wasn't for the ads I would give 5 star's,1
Painful number of ads,1
Adds more than game,1
"Boring trash game, it's so random some times you pick the best multipliers and there's no way for you to win and an ad every time you finish a level is annoying",1
Terrible! Played the full game and completed the entire America map but it still makes you battle after it's a terrible game,1
Way too many ads. Kills the fun.,1
Worst ever don't install this 😒😑😕,1
all ads,1
Ads ads ads and again ads! Pathetic!,1
Bad. Ads,1
"Too much ads, cannot play, remove",1
The game is just an ad farm. You'll spend more time watching ads than playing.,1
Yeah nah...5 second ads after every 10 second level. Add to that the you must click the X dead centre within a 2 pixel margin or you will be taken to the page the ad links to.,1
"Too many ads, so I'm uninstalling after playing for less than 5 minutes. There has been 9 ads so far, all unskippable. The ads are longer than the levels",1
Too many advertisements..,1
Too many adds,1
"So littered with ads that the game is actually unplayable. Cool concept, but the 30 sec constant ads ruin it",1
"This is barely even a game. That by itself isn't necessarily bad, but this app takes literally every opportunity it can to put in ads. Playing a level? Banner ad at the bottom. Beat a level? Video ad with the annoying x. Oh and it's not every few level like a lot of these apps. It's literally. Every. Single. Level. It's to the point where you spend more time looking at ads than actually playing this sad excuse for a game. This app is free but it's not even worth that much.",1
Unsatisfied. Just another revenue generator. People used to make games because they enjoyed it and had passion to make games for other people's enjoyment. Not for money.,1
Basically just an add watching simulator. Spend more time watching adds after level than the level takes to play.,1
Pathetic game,1
"Well, if you like ads, you'll love this game.",1
"Too many ads... After every level its almost a min of ads, with levels being 15 secounds long.",1
I was wondering why an interesting game had such a low rating. You can't play more than 5 seconds without being forced to see an ad. You see an ad after each round and the rounds are very short. You end up spending more time watching ads than actually playing the game.,1
Good game for about 5 seconds until the next 30 second unskippable ad comes on.,1
"Very baaaaad, too many ad, made me nervous",1
I understand the need for ads but when your ad time is almost double pf your play time. Its not a game I wish to consume.,1
"Believe the reviews. Game itself is decent, but each lvl is about 10s of play, followed by 30s of ads. It's unbearable after 2 minutes.",1
"Exactly as others say. 10 secs of gameplay, 30 secs of adverts. Just an ad farm game don't waste your time",1
"It's a shame that there are so many ads! This is such a good game! Understand that people have to make money, but even an ad after 5 or 6 levels would be better!",1
